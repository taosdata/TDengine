# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})


# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
  # rack = "1a"
  ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
  # user = "$USER"


# Configuration for telegraf agent

  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs

  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "TelegrafInterval"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  precision = ""

  ## Log only error level messages.

  ## is determined by the "logfile" setting.
  # logtarget = "file"

  ## Name of the file to be logged to when using the "file" logtarget.  If set to
  ## the empty string then logs are written to stderr.
  # logfile = ""

  ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
  ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
  # logfile_rotation_interval = "0d"

  ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
  ## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

  ## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
  ## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

  ## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
  ## Example: America/Chicago
  # log_with_timezone = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = ""
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.

#   ## The mapping mode specifies how Telegraf records are represented in Timestream.
#   ## Valid values are: single-table, multi-table.
#   ## For example, consider the following data in line protocol format:
#   ## weather,location=us-midwest,season=summer temperature=82,humidity=71 1465839830100400200
#   ## airquality,location=us-west no2=5,pm25=16 1465839830100400200
#   ## where weather and airquality are the measurement names, location and season are tags,
#   ## and temperature, humidity, no2, pm25 are fields.
#   ## In multi-table mode:
#   ##  - first line will be ingested to table named weather
#   ##  - second line will be ingested to table named airquality
#   ##  - the tags will be represented as dimensions
#   ##  - first table (weather) will have two records:
#   ##      one with measurement name equals to temperature,
#   ##      another with measurement name equals to humidity
#   ##  - second table (airquality) will have two records:
#   ##      one with measurement name equals to no2,
#   ##      another with measurement name equals to pm25
#   ##  - the Timestream tables from the example will look like this:
#   ##      TABLE "weather":
#   ##        time | location | season | measure_name | measure_value::bigint
#   ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | temperature | 82

#   ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-west | pm25 | 16
#   ## In single-table mode:
#   ##  - the data will be ingested to a single table, which name will be valueOf(single_table_name)
#   ##  - measurement name will stored in dimension named valueOf(single_table_dimension_name_for_telegraf_measurement_name)
#   ##  - location and season will be represented as dimensions
#   ##  - temperature, humidity, no2, pm25 will be represented as measurement name
#   ##  - the Timestream table from the example will look like this:
#   ##      Assuming:
#   ##        - single_table_name = "my_readings"
#   ##        - single_table_dimension_name_for_telegraf_measurement_name = "namespace"
#   ##      TABLE "my_readings":
#   ##        time | location | season | namespace | measure_name | measure_value::bigint
#   ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | weather | temperature | 82
#   ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | weather | humidity | 71
