.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
If \fImatch_data\fP is NULL, this function does nothing. Otherwise,
\fImatch_data\fP must point to a match data block, which this function frees,
using the memory freeing function from the general context or compiled pattern
with which it was created, or \fBfree()\fP if that was not set.
.P
If the PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT was used for a successful match using this
match data block, the copy of the subject that was remembered with the block is
also freed.
.P
There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2api\fP

page and a description of the POSIX API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2posix\fP
