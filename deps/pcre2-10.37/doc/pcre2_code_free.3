.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
If \fIcode\fP is NULL, this function does nothing. Otherwise, \fIcode\fP must
point to a compiled pattern. This function frees its memory, including any
memory used by the JIT compiler. If the compiled pattern was created by a call
to \fBpcre2_code_copy_with_tables()\fP, the memory for the character tables is
also freed.
