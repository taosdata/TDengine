title: Performance Tuning
---
Performance optimization is a core part of ensuring the efficient and stable operation of TDengine. This chapter focuses on memory allocation strategies, performance testing methods and bottleneck analysis, helping users improve the database’s query throughput and reduce response latency in a targeted manner according to business workloads and hardware environments.

By configuring memory allocators, conducting performance stress testing with tools such as JMeter, and combining system resource monitoring, you can quickly locate performance bottlenecks and implement optimization solutions. In this way, the performance advantages of TDengine as a time-series database can be fully utilized in high-concurrency scenarios such as the Internet of Things and industrial monitoring.
