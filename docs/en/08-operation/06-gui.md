To facilitate users in more efficiently utilizing and managing TDengine, version 3.0 introduced a new visual componentâ€”taosExplorer. This component aims to help users manage TDengine clusters easily, even without SQL familiarity. Through taosExplorer, users can effortlessly monitor the operational status of TDengine, browse data, configure data sources, perform stream computations, and set up data subscriptions. Additionally, users can use taosExplorer for data backup, replication, synchronization operations, and to configure various access permissions for users. These features significantly simplify the database usage process and enhance the user experience.

This section introduces the basic functions of visual management.

## Login

After completing the installation and startup process of TDengine, users can immediately start using taosExplorer. This component listens on TCP port 6060 by default. Users only need to enter `http://<IP>:6060/login` (where IP is the user's address) in their browser to log in successfully. Upon successful login to the cluster, users will find that various functions are clearly divided into different modules in the left navigation bar. The main modules will be briefly introduced next.

## Runtime Monitoring Panel

After installing the TDengine data source plugin on Grafana, you can add the TDengine data source and import the TDengine Grafana Dashboard: TDengine for 3.x. By doing this, users will be able to monitor the operational status of TDengine in real-time and set up alerts without writing any code. For details, please refer to [Monitor Your Cluster](../monitor-your-cluster/).

## Programming

On the "Programming" page, users can see how different programming languages interact with TDengine to perform basic operations such as writing and querying data. Users can create an example project simply by copying and pasting code. Currently supported programming languages include Java, Go, Python, Node.js (JavaScript), C#, Rust, and R.

## Data Ingestion

By creating different tasks, users can import data from various external data sources into TDengine with zero code. Currently, TDengine supports data sources including AVEVA PI System, OPC-UA/DA, MQTT, Kafka, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, TDengine 2, TDengine 3, CSV, AVEVA Historian, etc. In the task configuration, users can also add ETL-related configurations.

On the task list page, users can start, stop, edit, delete tasks, and view the activity logs of the tasks.

For detailed information on data ingestion, please refer to [Data Ingestion].

## Data Browser

By clicking on the "Data Browser" entry in the feature list, users can create and delete databases, create and delete supertables and subtables, execute SQL statements, and view the execution results of SQL statements. In addition, super administrators have management permissions for databases, while other users do not have this feature. The following image shows:
