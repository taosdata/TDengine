TDengine is an [open source](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/open-source-time-series-database/), [high-performance](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/high-performance-time-series-database/), [cloud native](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/cloud-native-time-series-database/) [time-series database](https://tdengine.com/tsdb/) optimized for Internet of Things (IoT), Connected Cars, and Industrial IoT. Its code, including its cluster feature is open source under GNU AGPL v3.0. Besides the database engine, it provides [caching](../develop/cache), [stream processing](../develop/stream), [data subscription](../develop/tmq) and other functionalities to reduce the system complexity and cost of development and operation.

This section introduces the major features, competitive advantages, typical use-cases and benchmarks to help you get a high level overview of TDengine.

## Major Features

The major features are listed below:

1. Insert data
   - Supports [using SQL to insert](../develop/insert-data/sql-writing).
   - Supports [schemaless writing](../reference/schemaless/) just like NoSQL databases. It also supports standard protocols like [InfluxDB Line](../develop/insert-data/influxdb-line), [OpenTSDB Telnet](../develop/insert-data/opentsdb-telnet), [OpenTSDB JSON ](../develop/insert-data/opentsdb-json) among others.
   - Supports seamless integration with third-party tools like [Telegraf](../third-party/telegraf/), [Prometheus](../third-party/prometheus/), [collectd](../third-party/collectd/), [StatsD](../third-party/statsd/), [TCollector](../third-party/tcollector/), [EMQX](../third-party/emq-broker), [HiveMQ](../third-party/hive-mq-broker), and [Icinga2](../third-party/icinga2/), they can write data into TDengine with simple configuration and without a single line of code.
2. Query data
   - Supports standard [SQL](../taos-sql/), including nested query.
   - Supports [time series specific functions](../taos-sql/function/#time-series-extensions) and [time series specific queries](../taos-sql/distinguished), like downsampling, interpolation, cumulated sum, time weighted average, state window, session window and many others.
   - Supports [User Defined Functions (UDF)](../taos-sql/udf).
3. [Caching](../develop/cache/): TDengine always saves the last data point in cache, so Redis is not needed for time-series data processing.
4. [Stream Processing](../develop/stream/): Not only is the continuous query is supported, but TDengine also supports event driven stream processing, so Flink or Spark is not needed for time-series data processing.
5. [Data Subscription](../develop/tmq/): Application can subscribe a table or a set of tables. API is the same as Kafka, but you can specify filter conditions.
6. Visualization
   - Supports seamless integration with [Grafana](../third-party/grafana/).
   - Supports seamless integration with [Google Data Studio](../third-party/google-data-studio/).
7. Cluster
   - Supports [cluster](../deployment/) with the capability of increasing processing power by adding more nodes.
   - Supports [deployment on Kubernetes](../deployment/k8s/).
   - Supports high availability via data replication.
8. Administration
   - Provides [monitoring](../operation/monitor) on running instances of TDengine.
   - Provides many ways to [import](../operation/import) and [export](../operation/export) data.
9. Tools
   - Provides an interactive [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../reference/taos-shell) for management, maintenance and ad-hoc queries.
   - Provides a tool [taosBenchmark](../reference/taosbenchmark/) for testing the performance of TDengine.
10. Programming
    - Provides [connectors](../reference/connector/) for [C/C++](../reference/connector/cpp), [Java](../reference/connector/java), [Python](../reference/connector/python), [Go](../reference/connector/go), [Rust](../reference/connector/rust), [Node.js](../reference/connector/node) and other programming languages.
    - Provides a [REST API](../reference/rest-api/).

## Competitive Advantages

By making full use of [characteristics of time series data](https://tdengine.com/tsdb/characteristics-of-time-series-data/), TDengine differentiates itself from other [time series databases](https://tdengine.com/tsdb), with the following advantages.

- **[High-Performance](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/high-performance-time-series-database/)**: TDengine is the only time-series database to solve the high cardinality issue to support billions of data collection points while out performing other time-series databases for data ingestion, querying and data compression.

- **[Simplified Solution](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/simplified-time-series-data-solution/)**: Through built-in caching, stream processing and data subscription features, TDengine provides a simplified solution for time-series data processing. It reduces system design complexity and operation costs significantly.

- **[Cloud Native](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/cloud-native-time-series-database/)**: Through native distributed design, sharding and partitioning, separation of compute and storage, RAFT, support for Kubernetes deployment and full observability, TDengine is a cloud native Time-series Database and can be deployed on public, private or hybrid clouds.

- **[Ease of Use](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/easy-time-series-data-platform/)**: For administrators, TDengine significantly reduces the effort to[
  ](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/easy-time-series-data-platform/) deploy and maintain. For developers, it provides a simple interface, simplified solution and seamless integrations for third party tools. For data users, it gives easy data access.

- **[Easy Data Analytics](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/time-series-data-analytics-made-easy/)**: Through super tables, storage and compute separation, data partitioning by time interval, pre-computation and other means, TDengine makes it easy to explore, format, and get access to data in a highly efficient way.

- **[Open Source](https://tdengine.com/tdengine/open-source-time-series-database/)**: TDengine’s core modules, including cluster feature, are all available under open source licenses. It has gathered over 19k stars on GitHub. There is an active developer community, and over 140k running instances worldwide.

With TDengine, the total cost of ownership of your time-series data platform can be greatly reduced.

1. With its superior performance, the computing and storage resources are reduced significantly.
2. With SQL support, it can be seamlessly integrated with many third party tools, and learning costs/migration costs are reduced significantly.
3. With its simplified solution and nearly zero management, the operation and maintenance costs are reduced significantly.

## Technical Ecosystem

This is how TDengine would be situated, in a typical time-series data processing platform:

<center><figcaption>Figure 1. TDengine Technical Ecosystem</figcaption></center>
</figure>

On the left-hand side, there are data collection agents like OPC-UA, MQTT, Telegraf and Kafka. On the right-hand side, visualization/BI tools, HMI, Python/R, and IoT Apps can be connected. TDengine itself provides an interactive command-line interface and a web interface for management and maintenance.

## Typical Use Cases

As a high-performance, scalable and SQL supported time-series database, TDengine's typical use case include but are not limited to IoT, Industrial Internet, Connected Vehicles, IT operation and maintenance, energy, financial markets and other fields. TDengine is a purpose-built database optimized for the characteristics of time series data. As such, it cannot be used to process data from web crawlers, social media, e-commerce, ERP, CRM and so on. More generally TDengine is not a suitable storage engine for non-time-series data. This section makes a more detailed analysis of the applicable scenarios.
