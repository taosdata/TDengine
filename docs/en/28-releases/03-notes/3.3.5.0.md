  2. fix: write tmq data into target error when terrno already set 
  3. fix: taosd cannot start when there is data corruption in a block within the WAL 
  4. fix: taosBenchmark fails when taosd disconnected in replica 2/3 
  5. fix: log files being lost when they are switched frequently. 
  6. fix: the stream computing stops due to the data update within the window. 
  7. fix: libtaosws.so sets an incorrect error code when the connection is terminated while fetch data. 
  8. fix: taosX opc error in case of @-prefixed name 
  9. fix: fix permission denied with show vgroups sql in cloud 
 10. fix: fix sql syntax error when migrating from large stables with compress options 
 11. fix: incorrect memory estimation for vnode usage 
 12. fix: failed to perform UNION ALL query on constant strings of the varchar type. 
 13. fix: leader transfer during the execution of transaction may cause deadlock. 
 14. fix: rust connector invliad pointer addr in ws_stmt_get_tag_fields 
 15. fix: union statement fails when executing with subqueries containing multiple NULLs. 
 16. fix: the pause operation of stream computing might fail. 
 17. fix: when writing data into a sub-table with a table name length of 192 characters using an SQL statement, errors may occur if the table name is enclosed in backticks (`). 
 18. fix: when performing a join query on super tables across different databases, if each database contains only one vnode, the query will return an error. 
 19. fix: no enough disk space cause taosX panic 
 20. fix: when write data to a super table, using both bound and unbound simultaneously will trigger an exception. 
 21. fix: metrics non-exist cause panic when connect with agent 
 22. fix: when creating indexes for tag with a large character length, taosd may crash. 
 23. fix: when the input parameters for the functions first, last, last_row, and char exceed 127, the taosd may crash. https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine/issues/29241
 24. fix: when the number of rows in the result set of the LIMIT statement exceeds the size of a single data block, the returned count does not match the expectation. 
 25. fix: when synchronizing data between clusters, if the target task is deleted, the source cluster may run out of memory 
 26. fix: metadata read-write lock misconfiguration leads to a very small chance of blocking writes. 
 27. fix: when importing CSV files using the INSERT INTO statement on the Windows platform, the absence of a newline character at the end of the file may lead to an issue of infinite loop reading. 
 28. fix: after the tags of the table are updated, the stream computing fails to recognize and apply the ne values. 
 29. fix: fix kafka timeout issue and improve performance and stability 
 30. fix: in sql queries, when both 'is null' and invalid 'in' filter conditions are included simultaneously, the query results are incorrect. https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine/issues/29067
 31. fix: sql queries containing both 'IN' and 'BETWEEN' filter conditions result in incorrect query results. https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine/issues/28989
