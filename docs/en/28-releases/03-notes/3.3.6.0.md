## Fixes
  1. fix: OOM may occur when dropping a super table containing a large number of child-tables.
  2. fix: taosX util to read archived data
  3. fix: explorer should raise error when password is not valid
  4. fix: In stmt2 interlace mode, asynchronous execution returns incorrect affectrow count.
  5. fix: explorer display error reason for backup tasks
  6. fix: vnode may go offline when dnode is overloaded
  7. fix: stream computing experiences a significant backlog of transactions during vgroup leader switch, resulting in computational delays.
  8. fix: fix explorer oss --version error
  9. fix: support special characters of password in Node.js
 10. fix: random value out of range in taosBenchmark
 11. fix: fix os error 10053 on windows for OPCUA
 12. fix: taosX panic when adapter/nginx restarted in some cases
 13. fix: the results of the show disk_info command are incorrect when configuring multi-level storage.
 14. fix: typo in the execution result of `show <database>.disk_info`
 15. fix: when querying super table, using ORDER BY and LIMIT together may return an unexpected record.
 16. fix: allow health params in 2.x data-in 
 17. fix: backup next execution time does allow past time
 18. fix: fix compatibility of backup task upgrading to latest
 19. fix: query error when performing a UNION operation on multiple nested queries.
 20. fix: in state window queries, if the same expression exists in both the PARTITION BY and SELECT clauses, it will cause taosd to crash.
 21. fix: when the subquery does not return any results but contains the LIMIT 1 clause, it may cause the result of the parent query to be abnormal or inaccurate.
 22. fix: taosc crash when table names contain `*`
 23. fix: on windows, closing a JDBC PreparedStatement while writing data may cause the JVM to crash.[#30106](https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine/issues/30106)
