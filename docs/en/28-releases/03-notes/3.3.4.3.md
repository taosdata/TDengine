## New Features
1. feat: the twa function in stream computing support time-driven result push mode. 
1. feat: the interp function in stream computing support time-driver result push mode. 
1. feat: support Azure Blob 

## Optimizations
1. enh: improve the efficiency of pulling data between dnodes when performing large concurrent query. 
1. enh: support use AVX2 and AVX512 to perform decoding optimization for double, timestamp and bigint types. 
1. enh: adjust the result type of the case when statement. 
1. enh: optimized the error msg when compact + split vgroup operation is performed in sequence
1. enh: improve the data scanning speed of the query "select... from... where ts in (...)". 
1. enh: add a compatiability guarantee mechanism for stream, to avoid new compatiblity issued caused by subsequent functions, but the previously created stream must be deleted and recreated. 
1. enh: improve the data synchronization performance of taosX in interlace scenarios. 
1. enh: support turn off encoding for integer and float data types. 
1. enh: in a multi-replica database, snode must be used in stream computing. 
1. enh: generate unique ID to identify each query task to avoid memory corruption. 
1. enh: speed up the creation time of the database. 
1. enh: modify the default value of s3MigrateEnabled to 0. 
1. enh: support recording delete operations in the audit database. 
1. enh: support create database in the specified dnode list [enterprise]. 
1. enh: adjust the error message when deleting data columns of the super table. 

[Fixed issues] 
1. fix: query performance of last_row has significantly decreased in version 3.3.3.0. 
1. fix: taosd cannot start when the WAL entry is incomplete. 
1. fix: incorrect query results when partitioning by a constant. 
1. fix: when the scalar function include _wstart and the fill method is prev, the calculation result is wrong. 
1. fix: the time zone setting problem on Windows. 
1. fix: the translation can't finish if compacting on empty database [enterprise] 
1. fix: logic error with transaction conflicts 
1. fix: some errors of the mnode can cause transactions to be unable to stop. 
1. fix: some errors of the mnode can cause transactions to be unable to stop. 
1. fix: the problem of taosc driver retrying errors after clearing the dnode data. 
1. fix: after Data Compact is abnormally terminated, intermediate files are not cleaned up. 
1. fix: after adding a new column, the earliest mode of the Kafka connector cannot consume the data of the new column. 
1. fix: the behavior of the interp function is incorrect when use fill(prev). 
1. fix: the problem that TSMA abnormally stops during high-frequency metadata operations. 
1. fix: the execution result of the "show create stable" statement is incorrect. 
1. fix: the percentile function will crash when querying a large amount of data. 
1. fix: syntax error when using partition by and having together. 
1. fix: tbname is empty when interp function is used with partition by tbname, c1. 
1. fix: taosd may crash while writing illegal boolean values through stmt. 
1. fix: library symbol 'version' confict with other lib which use the same symbol. 
1. fix: the number of JAVA process handles in JDBC driver keeps increasing on Windows environment. 
1. fix: the occasional startup failure when upgrading from version 3.3.3.1 to 3.3.4.0. 
1. fix: memory leak caused by repeated addition and deletion of tables on the Windows platform. 
1. fix(stream): check the right return code for concurrent checkpoint trans. 
1. fix: the "too many session" problem while perform large concurrent queries. 
2. fix: the problem of TDengine CLI crashing in slow query scenarios on the Windows platform. 
3. fix: the encrypted database cannot be recovered when opening the dnode log. 
4. fix: the problem that taosd cannot be started due to mnode synchronization timeout. 
5. fix: the slow sorting of file group data during snapshot synchronization leads to the inability of Vnode to recover. 
6. fix: when writing data with escape characters to a varchar field throug line protocol, taosd will crash. 
7. fix: metadata file damage caused by incorrect logic processing of error code 
8. fix: when a query statement contains multiple nested "not" conditional statements, not setting the scalar mode will lead to query errors. 
9. fix: the problem of dnode going offline due to timeout of vnode stat report. 
10. fix: taosd failed to start on servers that not support AVX instructions. 
11. fix(taosX): handle 0x09xx error codes in migration
