If you did not set environment variable for a TDengine Cloud instance, or you want to access other TDengine Cloud instances rather than the instance you already set the environment variable, you can use `taos -E <DSN>` as below.

```
taos -E $TDENGINE_CLOUD_DSN
```

## Using TDengine CLI

TDengine CLI will display a welcome message and version information if it successfully connected to the TDengine service. If it fails, TDengine CLI will print an error message. The TDengine CLI prompts as follows:

```
Welcome to the TDengine shell from Linux, Client Version:3.0.0.0
Copyright (c) 2022 by TAOS Data, Inc. All rights reserved.

Successfully connect to cloud.tdengine.com:8085 in restful mode

taos>
```

After entering the TDengine CLI, you can execute various SQL commands, including inserts, queries, or administrative commands. Please see the [official document](https://docs.tdengine.com/reference/taos-shell#execute-sql-script-file) for more details.
