import PkgListV3 from "/components/PkgListV3";

1. Download the client installation package
  
  <PkgListV3 type={1} sys="Linux" />

   [All Downloads](../../releases)

2. Unzip

   Download the package to any directory the current user has read/write permission. Then execute `tar -xzvf TDengine-client-VERSION.tar.gz` command.
   The VERSION should be the version of the package you just downloaded.
3. Execute the install script

   Once the package is unzipped, you will see the following files in the directory:
   - _ install_client.sh_: install script
   - _ taos.tar.gz_: client driver package
   - _ driver_: TDengine client driver
   - _examples_: some example programs of different programming languages (C/C#/go/JDBC/MATLAB/python/R)
   You can run `install_client.sh`  to install it.
4. configure taos.cfg

   Edit `taos.cfg` file (full path is `/etc/taos/taos.cfg` by default), modify `firstEP` with actual TDengine server's End Point, for example `h1.tdengine.com:6030`

:::tip

1. If the computer does not run the TDengine service but installs the TDengine client driver, then you need to config `firstEP` in  `taos.cfg` only, and there is no need to configure `FQDN`;
2. If you encounter the "Unable to resolve FQDN" error, please make sure the FQDN in the `/etc/hosts` file of the current computer is correctly configured, or the DNS service is correctly configured.
