By using the RJDBC library in R, you can enable R programs to access TDengine data. Here are the installation process, configuration steps, and an example code in R.

## Installation Process

Before getting started, make sure you have installed the R language environment. Then, follow these steps to install and configure the RJDBC library:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): RJDBC library requires Java environment. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the official Oracle website and follow the installation guide.

2. Install the RJDBC library: Execute the following command in the R console to install the RJDBC library.

```r
install.packages("RJDBC", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

:::note
1. The default R language package version 4.2 which shipped with Ubuntu might lead unresponsive bug. Please install latest version of R language package from the [official website](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. On Linux systems, installing the RJDBC package may require installing the necessary components for compilation. For example, on Ubuntu, you can execute the command ``apt install -y libbz2-dev libpcre2-dev libicu-dev`` to install the required components.
3. On Windows systems, you need to set the **JAVA_HOME** environment variable.

3. Download the TDengine JDBC driver: Visit the Maven website and download the TDengine JDBC driver (taos-jdbcdriver-X.X.X-dist.jar) to your local machine.

## Configuration Process

Once you have completed the installation steps, you need to do some configuration to enable the RJDBC library to connect and access the TDengine time-series database.

1. Load the RJDBC library and other necessary libraries in your R script:

```r
library(DBI)
library(rJava)
library(RJDBC)
```

2. Set the JDBC driver and JDBC URL:

```r
# Set the JDBC driver path (specify the location on your local machine)
driverPath <- "/path/to/taos-jdbcdriver-X.X.X-dist.jar"

# Set the JDBC URL (specify the FQDN and credentials of your TDengine cluster)
url <- "jdbc:TAOS://localhost:6030/?user=root&password=taosdata"
```

3. Load the JDBC driver:

```r
# Load the JDBC driver
drv <- JDBC("com.taosdata.jdbc.TSDBDriver", driverPath)
```

4. Create a TDengine database connection:

```r
# Create a database connection
conn <- dbConnect(drv, url)
```

5. Once the connection is established, you can use the ``conn`` object for various database operations such as querying data and inserting data.

6. Finally, don't forget to close the database connection after you are done:

```r
# Close the database connection
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

## Example Code Using RJDBC in R

Here's an example code that uses the RJDBC library to connect to a TDengine time-series database and perform a query operation:

<Rdemo/>

Please modify the JDBC driver, JDBC URL, username, password, and SQL query statement according to your specific TDengine time-series database environment and requirements.

By following the steps and using the provided example code, you can use the RJDBC library in the R language to access the TDengine time-series database and perform tasks such as data querying and analysis.
