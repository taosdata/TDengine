Go to the `C:\TDengine` directory from `cmd` and execute TDengine CLI program `taos.exe` directly to connect to the TDengine service and enter the TDengine CLI interface, for example, as follows:

```text
taos> show databases;
              name              |
=================================
 information_schema             |
 performance_schema             |
 test                           |
Query OK, 3 rows in database (0.123000s)

taos>
```
