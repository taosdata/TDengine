import PkgListV3 from "/components/PkgListV3";

1. Download the client installation package

  <PkgListV3 type={8} sys="macOS" />

   [All Downloads](../../releases/tdengine)

2. Execute the installer, select the default value as prompted, and complete the installation. If the installation is blocked, you can right-click or ctrl-click on the installation package and select `Open`.
3. configure taos.cfg

   Edit `taos.cfg` file (full path is `/etc/taos/taos.cfg` by default), modify `firstEP` with actual TDengine server's End Point, for example `h1.tdengine.com:6030`

:::tip

1. If the computer does not run the TDengine service but installs the TDengine client driver, then you need to config `firstEP` in  `taos.cfg` only, and there is no need to configure `FQDN`;
2. If you encounter the "Unable to resolve FQDN" error, please make sure the FQDN in the `/etc/hosts` file of the current computer is correctly configured, or the DNS service is correctly configured.
