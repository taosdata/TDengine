title: Connector
---

TDengine provides a rich set of APIs (application development interface). To facilitate users to develop their applications quickly, TDengine supports connectors for multiple programming languages, including official connectors for C/C++, Java, Python, Go, Node.js, C#, and Rust. These connectors support connecting to TDengine clusters using both native interfaces (taosc) and REST interfaces (not supported in a few languages yet). Community developers have also contributed several unofficial connectors, such as the ADO.NET connector, the Lua connector, and the PHP connector.

## Supported platforms

Currently, TDengine's native interface connectors can support platforms such as x64 and ARM hardware platforms and Linux and Windows development environments. The comparison matrix is as follows.

| **CPU**        | **OS**    | **Java** | **Python** | **Go** | **Node.js** | **C#** | **Rust** | C/C++ |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| **X86 64bit**  | **Linux** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ●      | ●        | ●     |
| **X86 64bit**  | **Win64** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ●      | ●        | ●     |
| **ARM64**      | **Linux** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ○      | ○        | ●     |

Where ● means the official test verification passed, ○ means the unofficial test verification passed, -- means no assurance.

Using REST connection can support a broader range of operating systems as it does not rely on client drivers.

## Version support

TDengine version updates often add new features, and the connector versions in the list are the best-fit versions of the connector.

| **TDengine Versions** | **Java** | **Python** | **Go** | **C#** | **Node.js** | **Rust** |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| **3.0.0.0 and later**    | 3.0.0    | current version   | 3.0 branch     | 3.0.0         | 3.0.0           | current version |
| **2.4.0.14 and up** | 2.0.38 | current version | develop branch | 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 | 2.0.10 - 2.0.12 | current version |
| **2.4.0.6 and up** | 2.0.37 | current version | develop branch | 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 | 2.0.10 - 2.0.12 | current version |
| **2.4.0.4 - 2.4.0.5** | 2.0.37 | current version | develop branch | 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 | 2.0.10 - 2.0.12 | current version |
| **2.2.x.x ** | 2.0.36 | current version | master branch | n/a | 2.0.7 - 2.0.9 | current version |
| **2.0.x.x ** | 2.0.34 | current version | master branch | n/a | 2.0.1 - 2.0.6 | current version |

## Functional Features

Comparing the connector support for TDengine functional features as follows.

### Using the native interface (taosc)

| **Functional Features** | **Java** | **Python** | **Go** | **C#** | **Node.js** | **Rust** |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| **Connection Management** | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support |
| **Regular Query** | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support |
| **Parameter Binding** | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support |
| ** TMQ **      | Support     | Support       | Support   | Support   | Support        | Support     |
| **Schemaless** | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support |
| **DataFrame** | Not Supported | Support | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |

:::info
The different database framework specifications for various programming languages do not mean that all C/C++ interfaces need a wrapper.

| **DataFrame** | Not supported | Support | Not supported | N/A | Not supported | Not supported |

:::warning

- Regardless of the programming language chosen for the connector, TDengine versions 2.0 and above recommend that each thread of a database application create a separate connection. Or create a connection pool based on threads to avoid interference between threads with the "USE statement" state within a connection (but the connection's query and write operations are thread-safe).

import VerifyWindows from "./_verify_windows.mdx";
import VerifyLinux from "./_verify_linux.mdx";

## Install Client Driver

:::info
The client driver needs to be installed if you use the native interface connector on a system that does not have the TDengine server software installed.

:::

### Install

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <InstallOnWindows />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    <InstallOnLinux />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify

After completing the above installation and configuration and you have confirmed that the TDengine service is up and running, you can execute the TDengine CLI tool to log in.

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <VerifyLinux />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    <VerifyWindows />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
