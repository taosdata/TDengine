title: Connector
description: This document describes the connectors that TDengine provides to interface with various programming languages.
---

TDengine provides a rich set of APIs (application development interface). To facilitate users to develop their applications quickly, TDengine supports connectors for multiple programming languages, including official connectors for C/C++, Java, Python, Go, Node.js, C#, and Rust. These connectors support connecting to TDengine clusters using both native interfaces (taosc) and REST interfaces (not supported in a few languages yet). Community developers have also contributed several unofficial connectors, such as the ADO.NET connector, the Lua connector, and the PHP connector.

## Supported platforms

Currently, TDengine's native interface connectors can support platforms such as x64 and ARM hardware platforms and Linux/Windows/macOS development environments. The comparison matrix is as follows.

| **CPU**        | **OS**    | **Java** | **Python** | **Go** | **Node.js** | **C#** | **Rust** | C/C++ |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| **X86 64bit**  | **Linux** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ●      | ●        | ●     |
| **X86 64bit**  | **Win64** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ●      | ●        | ●     |
| **X86 64bit**  | **macOS** | ○        | ●          | ●      | ○           | ○      | ●        | ●     |
| **ARM64**      | **Linux** | ●        | ●          | ●      | ●           | ○      | ○        | ●     |
| **ARM64**      | **macOS** | ○        | ●          | ●      | ○           | ○      | ●        | ●     |

Where ● means the official test verification passed, ○ means the unofficial test verification passed, -- means no assurance.

Using REST connection can support a broader range of operating systems as it does not rely on client drivers.

## Version support

TDengine version updates often add new features, and the connector versions in the list are the best-fit versions of the connector.

| **TDengine Versions**       | **Java**       | **Python**     | **Go**         | **C#**        | **Node.js**     | **Rust**        |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **3.0.0.0 and later**       | 3.0.2 +        | latest version | 3.0 branch     | 3.0.0         | 3.0.0           | current version |
| **2.4.0.14 and up **        | 2.0.38         | latest version | develop branch | 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 | 2.0.10 - 2.0.12 | current version |

:::info
The different database framework specifications for various programming languages do not mean that all C/C++ interfaces need a wrapper.

:::warning

- Regardless of the programming language chosen for the connector, TDengine versions 2.0 and above recommend that each thread of a database application create a separate connection. Or create a connection pool based on threads to avoid interference between threads with the "USE statement" state within a connection (but the connection's query and write operations are thread-safe).

## Install Client Driver

:::info
The client driver needs to be installed if you use the native interface connector on a system that does not have the TDengine server software installed.

:::

### Install

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    <InstallOnMacOS />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify

After completing the above installation and configuration and you have confirmed that the TDengine service is up and running, you can execute the TDengine CLI tool to log in.

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
