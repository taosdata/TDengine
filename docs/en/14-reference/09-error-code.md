| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x80002800 | Function internal error                    | An error caused by invalid function parameters. For example, the APERCENTILE function only accepts "default" or "t-digest" as the third parameter. If other inputs are used, this error occurs. Similarly, the TO_ISO8601 function might fail if the timezone string is invalid. | Adjust function input based on the specific error message.           |
| 0x80002801 | Invalid function parameter number          | The number of input parameters is incorrect. For example, the function requires `n` parameters, but the user provides a different number, like COUNT(col1, col2).                          | Provide the correct number of parameters.                           |
| 0x80002802 | Invalid function parameter type            | The function received a parameter of the wrong type. For example, the SUM function expects a numerical value, but a string like SUM("abc") was provided.                                  | Provide the correct parameter types.                                |
| 0x80002803 | Invalid function parameter value           | The parameter value is out of range. For example, the SAMPLE function only accepts a range of [1, 1000] for its second parameter.                                                         | Adjust the parameter values to be within the valid range.            |
| 0x80002804 | Not a built-in function                    | The function is not recognized as a built-in function. This might happen if the internal function hash table initialization fails or is corrupted.                                         | This is likely a bug. Contact the development team.                 |
| 0x80002805 | Duplicate timestamps not allowed in function | The function received duplicate timestamps in the primary key column. In certain time-dependent functions like CSUM, DERIVATIVE, or MAVG, merged data from multiple sub-tables with identical timestamps may lead to meaningless calculations and errors. | Ensure that no duplicate timestamps exist in sub-table data.         |
