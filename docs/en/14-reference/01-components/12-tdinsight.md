TDinsight is a monitoring solution for TDengine using [Grafana].

TDengine writes information such as server CPU, memory, disk space, bandwidth, request count, disk read/write speed, and slow queries into a specified database periodically through taosKeeper. By using Grafana and the TDengine data source plugin, TDinsight visualizes cluster status, node information, insert and query requests, and resource usage, providing developers with the convenience to monitor the operational status of the TDengine cluster in real-time. This document will guide users on how to install the TDengine data source plugin and deploy the TDinsight visualization dashboard.

## Prerequisites

First, check the following services:

- TDengine is installed and running normally. This dashboard requires TDengine 3.0.0.0 or above, and monitoring reporting configuration enabled. For specific configurations, please refer to: [TDengine Monitoring Configuration](../taosd/).
- taosAdapter is installed and running normally. For details, please refer to: [taosAdapter Reference Manual](../taosadapter)
- taosKeeper is installed and running normally. For details, please refer to: [taosKeeper Reference Manual](../taoskeeper)
- Grafana service is installed and running normally. We recommend using the latest version of Grafana, TDInsight supports Grafana 7.5 and above.
  :::info

  In the following description, we use Grafana v11.0.0 as an example. Other versions may differ in functionality, please refer to [Grafana Official Website](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).

  :::

Then record the following information:

- taosAdapter cluster REST API address, such as: `http://localhost:6041`.
- taosAdapter cluster authentication information, which can use username and password.
- taosKeeper database name for recording monitoring metrics.

## Install TDengine Data Source Plugin and Configure Data Source

For steps on installing the Grafana TDengine data source plugin and configuring the data source, please refer to: [Integration with Grafana](../../../third-party-tools/visualization/grafana/)

## Import TDinsightV3 Dashboard

In the TDengine data source configuration interface, click the "Dashboards" tab, then click "import" to import the "TDengine for 3.x" dashboard.
After successful import, you can access this dashboard. In the "Log from" option in the top left corner, select the database set in taosKeeper for recording monitoring metrics to view the monitoring results.

## TDinsightV3 Dashboard Details

The TDinsight dashboard aims to provide information on the usage and status of TDengine-related resources, such as dnodes, mnodes, vnodes, and databases.
It mainly includes Cluster Status, DNodes Overview, MNode Overview, Requests, Databases, DNode Resource Usage, and taosAdapter Monitoring Information. Below, we will explain each in detail.

### Cluster Status

### Automatic import of preconfigured alert rules

After summarizing user experience, 14 commonly used alert rules are sorted out. These alert rules can monitor key indicators of the TDengine cluster and report alerts, such as abnormal and exceeded indicators.  
Starting from TDengine-Server 3.3.4.3 (TDengine-datasource 3.6.3), TDengine Datasource supports automatic import of preconfigured alert rules. You can import 14 alert rules to Grafana (version 11 or later) with one click.  
In the TDengine-datasource setting interface, turn on the "Load Tengine Alert" switch, click the "Save & test" button, the plugin will automatically load the mentioned 14 alert rules. The rules will be placed in the Grafana alerts directory. If not required, turn off the "Load TDengine Alert" switch, and click the button next to "Clear TDengine Alert" to clear all the alert rules imported into this data source. 

After importing, click on "Alert rules" on the left side of the Grafana interface to view all current alert rules. By configuring contact points, users can receive alert notifications.

The specific configuration of the 14 alert rules is as follows:  

| alert rule                                                    | Rule threshold                       | Behavior when no data | Data scanning interval | Duration    | SQL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

TDengine users can modify and improve these alert rules according to their own business needs. In Grafana 7.5 and below versions, the Dashboard and Alert rules functions are combined, while in subsequent new versions, the two functions are separated. To be compatible with Grafana7.5 and below versions, an Alert Used Only panel has been added to the TDinsight panel, which is only required for Grafana7.5 and below versions.


## Upgrade

The following three methods can be used for upgrading:

- Use the graphical interface, if there is a new version, you can click update on the "TDengine Datasource" plugin page to upgrade.
- Follow the manual installation steps to install the new Grafana plugin and Dashboard yourself.
- Upgrade to the latest Grafana plugin and TDinsight Dashboard by rerunning the `TDinsight.sh` script.  

## Uninstallation

For different installation methods, when uninstalling:

- Use the graphical interface, click "Uninstall" on the "TDengine Datasource" plugin page.
- For TDinsight installed via the `TDinsight.sh` script, you can use the command line `TDinsight.sh -R` to clean up related resources.
- For manually installed TDinsight, to completely uninstall, you need to clean up the following:
  1. TDinsight Dashboard in Grafana.
  2. Data Source in Grafana.
  3. Delete the `tdengine-datasource` plugin from the plugin installation directory.

## Appendix

:::note
The new version of the plugin uses the Grafana unified alerting feature, the `-E` option is no longer supported.
:::

Assuming you start the TDengine database on the host `tdengine` with HTTP API port `6041`, user `root1`, and password `pass5ord`. Execute the script:

```shell
./TDinsight.sh -a http://tdengine:6041 -u root1 -p pass5ord
```

If you want to monitor multiple TDengine clusters, you need to set up multiple TDinsight dashboards. Setting up a non-default TDinsight requires some changes: the `-n` `-i` `-t` options need to be changed to non-default names, and if using the built-in SMS alert feature, `-N` and `-L` should also be changed.

```shell
sudo ./TDengine.sh -n TDengine-Env1 -a http://another:6041 -u root -p taosdata -i tdinsight-env1 -t 'TDinsight Env1'
```

Please note that configuring the data source, notification channel, and dashboard in the frontend is not changeable. You should update the configuration again through this script or manually change the configuration files in the `/etc/grafana/provisioning` directory (this is the default directory for Grafana, change as needed using the `-P` option).

Especially, when using Grafana Cloud or other organizations, `-O` can be used to set the organization ID. `-G` can specify the Grafana plugin installation directory. `-e` parameter sets the dashboard to be editable.
