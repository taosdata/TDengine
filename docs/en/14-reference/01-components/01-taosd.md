#### Explanation of Regional Related Parameters
1. To address the issue of data writing and querying across multiple time zones, TDengine uses Unix Timestamps to record and store timestamps. The nature of Unix Timestamps ensures that the timestamps generated are consistent at any given moment across any time zone. It is important to note that the conversion to Unix Timestamps is done on the client side. To ensure that other forms of time on the client are correctly converted to Unix Timestamps, it is necessary to set the correct time zone.

On Linux/macOS, the client automatically reads the time zone information set by the system. Users can also set the time zone in the configuration file in various ways. For example:

```text
timezone UTC-8
timezone GMT-8
timezone Asia/Shanghai
```

All are valid settings for the GMT+8 time zone. However, note that on Windows, the format `timezone Asia/Shanghai` is not supported, and must be written as `timezone UTC-8`.

The setting of the time zone affects the querying and writing of SQL statements involving non-Unix timestamp content (timestamp strings, interpretation of the keyword now). For example:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM table_name WHERE TS<'2019-04-11 12:01:08';
```

In GMT+8, the SQL statement is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM table_name WHERE TS<1554955268000;
```

In the UTC time zone, the SQL statement is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM table_name WHERE TS<1554984068000;
```

To avoid the uncertainties brought by using string time formats, you can also directly use Unix Timestamps. Additionally, you can use timestamp strings with time zones in SQL statements, such as RFC3339 formatted timestamp strings, 2013-04-12T15:52:01.123+08:00 or ISO-8601 formatted timestamp strings 2013-04-12T15:52:01.123+0800. The conversion of these two strings to Unix Timestamps is not affected by the system's local time zone.

2. TDengine provides a special field type, nchar, for storing wide characters in non-ASCII encodings such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Data written to the nchar field is uniformly encoded in UCS4-LE format and sent to the server. It is important to note that the correctness of the encoding is ensured by the client. Therefore, if users want to properly use the nchar field to store non-ASCII characters such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, they need to correctly set the client's encoding format.

The characters input by the client use the current default encoding format of the operating system, which is often UTF-8 on Linux/macOS systems, but may be GB18030 or GBK on some Chinese systems. The default encoding in a Docker environment is POSIX. In Chinese version Windows systems, the encoding is CP936. The client needs to ensure the correct setting of the character set they are using, i.e., the current encoding character set of the operating system on which the client is running, to ensure that the data in nchar is correctly converted to UCS4-LE encoding format.

In Linux/macOS, the naming rule for locale is: \<language>_\<region>.\<character set encoding> such as: zh_CN.UTF-8, where zh represents Chinese, CN represents mainland China, and UTF-8 represents the character set. The character set encoding provides instructions for the client to correctly parse local strings. Linux/macOS can set the system's character encoding by setting the locale, but since Windows uses a locale format that is not POSIX standard, another configuration parameter charset is used to specify the character encoding in Windows. Charset can also be used in Linux/macOS to specify the character encoding.

3. If charset is not set in the configuration file, in Linux/macOS, taos automatically reads the current locale information of the system at startup, and extracts the charset encoding format from the locale information. If it fails to automatically read the locale information, it attempts to read the charset configuration, and if reading the charset configuration also fails, it interrupts the startup process.

In Linux/macOS, the locale information includes character encoding information, so after correctly setting the locale in Linux/macOS, there is no need to set charset separately. For example:

```text
locale zh_CN.UTF-8
```

In Windows systems, it is not possible to obtain the current encoding from the locale. If it is not possible to read the string encoding information from the configuration file, taos defaults to setting the character encoding to CP936. This is equivalent to adding the following configuration in the configuration file:

```text
charset CP936
```

If you need to adjust the character encoding, please consult the encoding used by the current operating system and set it correctly in the configuration file.

In Linux/macOS, if the user sets both locale and charset encoding, and if the locale and charset are inconsistent, the latter setting will override the earlier one.

```text
locale zh_CN.UTF-8
charset GBK
```

Then the effective value of charset is GBK.

```text
charset GBK
locale zh_CN.UTF-8
```

The effective value of charset is UTF-8.

### Compression Parameters

|Parameter Name         |Supported Version        |Dynamic Modification|Description|
|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------|

| lossyColumn    | Before 3.3.0.0    |Not supported                     | Enables TSZ lossy compression for float and/or double types; range float/double/none; default value none, indicating lossless compression is off |
| ifAdtFse       |                   |Supported, effective after restart| When TSZ lossy compression is enabled, use the FSE algorithm instead of the HUFFMAN algorithm, FSE algorithm is faster in compression but slightly slower in decompression, choose this for faster compression speed; 0: off, 1: on; default value is 0 |

| compressor     |                   |Supported, effective after restart| Internal parameter, used for setting lossy compression |

**Additional Notes**

1. Effective in versions 3.2.0.0 ~ 3.3.0.0 (not inclusive), enabling this parameter will prevent rollback to the version before the upgrade
2. TSZ compression algorithm is completed through data prediction technology, thus it is more suitable for data with regular changes
3. TSZ compression time will be longer, if your server CPU is mostly idle and storage space is small, it is suitable to choose this
4. Example: Enable lossy compression for both float and double types

```shell
lossyColumns     float|double
```

5. Configuration requires service restart to take effect, if you see the following content in the taosd log after restarting, it indicates that the configuration has taken effect:

```sql
   02/22 10:49:27.607990 00002933 UTL  lossyColumns     float|double
```
