In the Telegraf configuration file (default location `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`) add an `outputs.http` section.

```
[[outputs.http]]
  url = "http://<taosAdapter's host>:<REST service port>/influxdb/v1/write?db=<database name>"
  ...
  username = "<TDengine's username>"
  password = "<TDengine's password>"
  ...
```

Where &lt;taosAdapter's host&gt; please fill in the server's domain name or IP address running the taosAdapter service. &lt;REST service port&gt; please fill in the port of the REST service (default is 6041). &lt;TDengine's username&gt; and &lt;TDengine's password&gt; please fill in the actual configuration of the currently running TDengine. And &lt;database name&gt; please fill in the database name where you want to store Telegraf data in TDengine.

An example is as follows.

```
[[outputs.http]]
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:6041/influxdb/v1/write?db=telegraf"
  method = "POST"
  timeout = "5s"
  username = "root"
  password = "taosdata"
  data_format = "influx"
```
