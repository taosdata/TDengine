description: The INFORMATION_SCHEMA database stores all metadata information in the system.

TDengine has a built-in database called `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which provides access to database metadata, system information, and status, such as the names of databases or tables, and currently executed SQL statements. This database stores information about all other databases maintained by TDengine. It contains several read-only tables. In fact, these tables are views rather than base tables, so there are no associated files with them. Therefore, you can only query these tables and cannot perform write operations such as INSERT. The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database is designed to provide access to information supported by various SHOW statements (like SHOW TABLES, SHOW DATABASES) in a more consistent manner. Compared to SHOW statements, using SELECT ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tablename has the following advantages:

1. You can use the USE statement to set `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` as the default database.
2. You can use the familiar SELECT statement syntax, only needing to learn some table names and column names.
3. You can filter, sort, and perform other operations on the query results. In fact, you can use any SELECT statement supported by TDengine to query the tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
4. TDengine can flexibly add columns to existing tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in future versions without worrying about affecting existing business systems.
5. It is more interoperable with other database systems. For example, Oracle database users are familiar with querying the Oracle data dictionary tables.

:::info

- Since SHOW statements have already been familiar and widely used by developers, they are still retained.
- Some columns in system tables may be keywords, and you need to use the escape character '\`' when querying, for example, to query how many VGROUPs database test has:

  ```sql
  select `vgroups` from ins_databases where name = 'test';
  ```

This chapter will detail the tables and table structures in the built-in metadata database `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
