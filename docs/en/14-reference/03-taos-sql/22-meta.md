TDengine has a built-in database called `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which provides access to database metadata, system information, and status, such as the names of databases or tables, the SQL statements currently being executed, etc. This database stores information about all other databases maintained by TDengine. It contains multiple read-only tables. In fact, these tables are views, not base tables, so there are no files associated with them. Therefore, you can only query these tables, and cannot perform write operations like INSERT. The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database is designed to provide access to the information provided by various SHOW statements supported by TDengine (such as SHOW TABLES, SHOW DATABASES) in a more consistent way. Compared to SHOW statements, using SELECT ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tablename has the following advantages:

1. You can use the USE statement to set INFORMATION_SCHEMA as the default database
2. You can use the familiar syntax of the SELECT statement, only needing to learn some table names and column names
3. You can filter, sort, and perform other operations on the query results. In fact, you can use any SELECT statement supported by TDengine to query the tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA
4. TDengine can flexibly add columns to the existing tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA in future evolutions without worrying about impacting existing business systems
5. More interoperable with other database systems. For example, Oracle database users are familiar with querying tables in the Oracle data dictionary

:::info

- Since SHOW statements are already familiar and widely used by developers, they are still retained.
- Some columns in the system tables may be keywords, and need to use the escape character '`' when querying, for example, to query how many VGROUPs the database test has:

```sql
   select `vgroups` from ins_databases where name = 'test';
```

This chapter will detail the tables and table structures in the built-in metadata database `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
