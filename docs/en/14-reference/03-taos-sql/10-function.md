**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- If `expr1` or `expr2` is NULL, return NULL.
- If `expr1` does not exist in `expr2`, return 0.
- If `expr1` is an empty string, it is considered to always successfully match in `expr2`, returning 1.
- The returned position is 1-based.
- This function is multi-byte safe.

```sql
taos> select position('a' in 'cba');
 position('a' in 'cba') |
=========================
                      3 |
 
 
taos> select position('' in 'cba');
 position('' in 'cba') |
========================
                     1 |
 
taos> select position('d' in 'cba');
 position('d' in 'cba') |
=========================
                      0 |
```

#### REPLACE

```sql
REPLACE(expr, from_str, to_str)
```

**Function Description**: Replaces all occurrences of `from_str` in the string with `to_str`.

**Return Type**: Same as the original type of the input field `expr`.

**Applicable Data Types**:

- `expr`: VARCHAR, NCHAR.
- `from_str`: VARCHAR, NCHAR.
- `to_str`: VARCHAR, NCHAR.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Notes**:

- This function is case-sensitive.
- If any argument is NULL, returns NULL.
- This function is multibyte safe.

**Example**:

```sql
taos> select replace('aabbccAABBCC', 'AA', 'DD');
 replace('aabbccAABBCC', 'AA', 'DD') |
======================================
 aabbccDDBBCC                        |
```

#### REPEAT

                  |
```

### Conversion Functions

Conversion functions convert values from one data type to another.

#### CAST

```sql
CAST(expr AS type_name)
```

**Function Description**: Data type conversion function, returns the result of converting `expr` to the type specified by `type_name`.

**Return Type**: The type specified in CAST (`type_name`).

**Applicable Data Types**: The type of input parameter `expr` can be any type except JSON and VARBINARY. If `type_name` is VARBINARY, then `expr` must be of VARCHAR type.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Notes**:

- Unsupported type conversions will result in an error.
- For supported types, if some values cannot be correctly converted, the output of the conversion function will prevail. Current possible scenarios include:
        1) Invalid character situations when converting string types to numeric types, e.g., "a" might convert to 0, but will not throw an error.
        2) When converting to numeric types, if the value exceeds the range that `type_name` can represent, it will overflow, but will not throw an error.
        3) When converting to string types, if the converted length exceeds the length specified in `type_name`, it will be truncated, but will not throw an error.

#### TO_ISO8601

```sql
TO_ISO8601(expr [, timezone])
```

**Function Description**: Converts a timestamp into the ISO8601 standard date and time format, with additional timezone information. The `timezone` parameter allows users to specify any timezone information for the output. If the `timezone` parameter is omitted, the output will include the current client system's timezone information.

**Return Data Type**: VARCHAR type.

**Applicable Data Types**: INTEGER, TIMESTAMP.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Notes**:

- The `timezone` parameter accepts timezone formats: [z/Z, +/-hhmm, +/-hh, +/-hh:mm]. For example, TO_ISO8601(1, "+00:00").
- The precision of the input timestamp is determined by the precision of the table queried, if no table is specified, the precision is milliseconds.

#### TO_JSON

```sql
TO_JSON(str_literal)
```

**Function Description**: Converts a string literal to JSON type.

**Return Data Type**: JSON.

**Applicable Data Types**: JSON strings, in the form '\{ "literal" : literal }'. '\{}' represents a null value. Keys must be string literals, and values can be numeric literals, string literals, boolean literals, or null literals. Escape characters are not supported in str_literal.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

#### TO_UNIXTIMESTAMP

```sql
TO_UNIXTIMESTAMP(expr [, return_timestamp])

return_timestamp: {
    0
  | 1
}
```

**Function Description**: Converts a datetime format string into a timestamp.

**Return Data Type**: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP.

**Applicable Fields**: VARCHAR, NCHAR.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Notes**:

- The input datetime string must conform to the ISO8601/RFC3339 standards, and formats that cannot be converted will return NULL.
- The precision of the returned timestamp is consistent with the time precision setting of the current DATABASE.
- return_timestamp specifies whether the function's return value is of TIMESTAMP type; setting it to 1 returns TIMESTAMP type, setting it to 0 returns BIGINT type. If not specified, it defaults to BIGINT type.

#### TO_CHAR

```sql
TO_CHAR(ts, format_str_literal)
```

**Function Description**: Converts a timestamp type to a string according to the specified format

**Version**: ver-3.2.2.0

**Usage Instructions**:

- The output format for `Month`, `Day`, etc., is left-aligned with spaces added to the right, such as `2023-OCTOBER  -01`, `2023-SEPTEMBER-01`. September has the longest number of letters among the months, so there is no space for September. Weeks are similar.
- When using `ms`, `us`, `ns`, the output of the above three formats only differs in precision, for example, if ts is `1697182085123`, the output for `ms` is `123`, for `us` is `123000`, and for `ns` is `123000000`.
- Content in the time format that does not match the rules will be output directly. If you want to specify parts of the format string that can match rules not to be converted, you can use double quotes, like `to_char(ts, 'yyyy-mm-dd "is formated by yyyy-mm-dd"')`. If you want to output double quotes, then add a backslash before the double quotes, like `to_char(ts, '\"yyyy-mm-dd\"')` will output `"2023-10-10"`.
- Formats that output numbers, such as `YYYY`, `DD`, uppercase and lowercase have the same meaning, i.e., `yyyy` and `YYYY` are interchangeable.
- It is recommended to include timezone information in the time format; if not included, the default output timezone is the timezone configured by the server or client.
- The precision of the input timestamp is determined by the precision of the table queried; if no table is specified, then the precision is milliseconds.

#### TO_TIMESTAMP

```sql
TO_TIMESTAMP(ts_str_literal, format_str_literal)
```

**Function Description**: Converts a string to a timestamp according to the specified format.

**Version**: ver-3.2.2.0

**Return Result Data Type**: TIMESTAMP

**Applicable Fields**: VARCHAR

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to inner and outer queries

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables

**Supported Formats**: Same as `to_char`

**Usage Instructions**:

- If `ms`, `us`, `ns` are specified at the same time, then the resulting timestamp includes the sum of these three fields. For example, `to_timestamp('2023-10-10 10:10:10.123.000456.000000789', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss.ms.us.ns')` outputs the timestamp corresponding to `2023-10-10 10:10:10.123456789`.
- `MONTH`, `MON`, `DAY`, `DY` and other formats that output numbers have the same meaning in uppercase and lowercase, such as `to_timestamp('2023-JANUARY-01', 'YYYY-month-dd')`, `month` can be replaced with `MONTH` or `Month`.
- If the same field is specified multiple times, the earlier specification will be overridden. For example, `to_timestamp('2023-22-10-10', 'yyyy-yy-MM-dd')`, the output year is `2022`.
- To avoid using an unintended timezone during conversion, it is recommended to carry timezone information in the time, for example, '2023-10-10 10:10:10+08'; if no timezone is specified, the default timezone is the one specified by the server or client.
- If a complete time is not specified, then the default time value is `1970-01-01 00:00:00` in the specified or default timezone, and the unspecified parts use the corresponding parts of this default value. Formats that only specify the year and day without specifying the month and day, like 'yyyy-mm-DDD', are not supported, but 'yyyy-mm-DD' is supported.
- If the format string contains `AM`, `PM`, etc., then the hour must be in 12-hour format, ranging from 01-12.
- `to_timestamp` conversion has a certain tolerance mechanism; even when the format string and timestamp string do not completely correspond, conversion is sometimes possible, like: `to_timestamp('200101/2', 'yyyyMM1/dd')`, the extra 1 in the format string will be discarded. Extra whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.) in the format string and timestamp string will also be automatically ignored. For example, `to_timestamp('  23 年 - 1 月 - 01 日  ', 'yy 年-MM月-dd日')` can be successfully converted. Although fields like `MM` require two digits (with a leading zero if only one digit), in `to_timestamp`, a single digit can also be successfully converted.
- The precision of the output timestamp is the same as the precision of the queried table; if no table is specified, then the output precision is milliseconds. For example, `select to_timestamp('2023-08-1 10:10:10.123456789', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss.ns')` will truncate microseconds and nanoseconds. If a nanosecond table is specified, truncation will not occur, like `select to_timestamp('2023-08-1 10:10:10.123456789', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss.ns') from db_ns.table_ns limit 1`.

### Time and Date Functions

Time and date functions operate on timestamp types.

All functions that return the current time, such as NOW, TODAY, and TIMEZONE, are calculated only once in a SQL statement, no matter how many times they appear.

#### NOW

```sql
NOW()
```

**Function Description**: Returns the current system time of the client.

**Return Result Data Type**: TIMESTAMP.

**Applicable Fields**: When used in WHERE or INSERT statements, it can only be applied to fields of TIMESTAMP type.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Usage Instructions**:

- Supports time addition and subtraction operations, such as NOW() + 1s. Supported time units include:
        b(nanoseconds), u(microseconds), a(milliseconds), s(seconds), m(minutes), h(hours), d(days), w(weeks).
- The precision of the returned timestamp is consistent with the time precision set in the current DATABASE.

#### TIMEDIFF

```sql
TIMEDIFF(expr1, expr2 [, time_unit])
```

**Function Description**: Returns the result of the timestamp `expr1` - `expr2`, which may be negative, and approximated to the precision specified by the `time_unit`.

**Return Result Type**: BIGINT.

**Applicable Data Types**:

- `expr1`: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP types representing timestamps, or VARCHAR, NCHAR types in ISO8601/RFC3339 standard date-time format.
- `expr2`: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP types representing timestamps, or VARCHAR, NCHAR types in ISO8601/RFC3339 standard date-time format.
- `time_unit`: See usage instructions.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- Supported time units `time_unit` include: 1b(nanoseconds), 1u(microseconds), 1a(milliseconds), 1s(seconds), 1m(minutes), 1h(hours), 1d(days), 1w(weeks).
- If the time unit `time_unit` is not specified, the precision of the returned time difference is consistent with the time precision set in the current DATABASE.
- Returns NULL if the input contains strings that do not conform to the date-time format.
- Returns NULL if `expr1` or `expr2` is NULL.
- If `time_unit` is NULL, it is equivalent to the time unit not being specified.
- The precision of the input timestamp is determined by the precision of the table being queried; if no table is specified, the precision is milliseconds.

**Example**:

```sql
taos> select timediff('2022-01-01 08:00:00', '2022-01-01 08:00:01',1s);
 timediff('2022-01-01 08:00:00', '2022-01-01 08:00:01',1s) |
============================================================
                                                        -1 |

taos> select timediff('2022-01-01 08:00:01', '2022-01-01 08:00:00',1s);
 timediff('2022-01-01 08:00:01', '2022-01-01 08:00:00',1s) |
============================================================
                                                         1 |
```

#### TIMETRUNCATE

```sql
TIMETRUNCATE(expr, time_unit [, use_current_timezone])

use_current_timezone: {
    0
  | 1
}
```

**Function Description**: Truncates the timestamp according to the specified time unit `time_unit`.

**Return Result Data Type**: TIMESTAMP.

**Applicable Fields**: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP types representing timestamps, or VARCHAR, NCHAR types in ISO8601/RFC3339 standard date-time format.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- Supported time units `time_unit` include:
          1b(nanoseconds), 1u(microseconds), 1a(milliseconds), 1s(seconds), 1m(minutes), 1h(hours), 1d(days), 1w(weeks).
- The precision of the returned timestamp is consistent with the time precision set in the current DATABASE.
- The precision of the input timestamp is determined by the precision of the table being queried; if no table is specified, the precision is milliseconds.
- Returns NULL if the input contains strings that do not conform to the date-time format.
- When using 1d/1w as the time unit to truncate timestamps, the `use_current_timezone` parameter can be set to specify whether to truncate based on the current timezone.
  A value of 0 means truncation using the UTC timezone, and a value of 1 means truncation using the current timezone.
  For example, if the client's configured timezone is UTC+0800, then TIMETRUNCATE('2020-01-01 23:00:00', 1d, 0) returns the East Eight Zone time '2020-01-01 08:00:00'.
  Using TIMETRUNCATE('2020-01-01 23:00:00', 1d, 1) returns the East Eight Zone time '2020-01-01 00:00:00'.
  When `use_current_timezone` is not specified, the default value is 1.
- When truncating the time value to a week (1w), the calculation of timetruncate is based on the Unix timestamp (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Since the Unix timestamp starts on a Thursday,
  all truncated dates are Thursdays.

#### TIMEZONE

```sql
TIMEZONE()
```

**Function Description**: Returns the current timezone information of the client.

**Return Data Type**: VARCHAR.

**Applicable Fields**: None

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

#### TODAY

```sql
TODAY()
```

**Function Description**: Returns the system time at midnight of the current day for the client.

**Return Data Type**: TIMESTAMP.

**Applicable Fields**: Can only be used with TIMESTAMP type fields when used in WHERE or INSERT statements.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- Supports time addition and subtraction operations, such as TODAY() + 1s. Supported time units include:
                b(nanoseconds), u(microseconds), a(milliseconds), s(seconds), m(minutes), h(hours), d(days), w(weeks).
- The precision of the returned timestamp is consistent with the time precision set for the current DATABASE.

#### WEEK

```sql
WEEK(expr [, mode])
```

**Function Description**: Returns the week number of the input date.

**Return Result Type**: BIGINT.

**Applicable Data Types**:

- `expr`: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP type representing a timestamp, or VARCHAR, NCHAR type conforming to ISO8601/RFC3339 date and time standards.
- `mode`: An integer between 0 - 7.

**Nested Subquery Support**: Applicable to both inner and outer queries.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- If `expr` is NULL, returns NULL.
- The precision of the input timestamp is determined by the precision of the table queried; if no table is specified, the precision is milliseconds.
- `mode` is used to specify whether the week starts on Sunday or Monday, and whether the return value range is 1 - 53 or 0 - 53. The following table details the calculation methods corresponding to different modes:

| Mode | First Day of the Week | Return Value Range  | Calculation Method for the 1st Week         |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Sunday                | 0 - 53              | The first week containing Sunday is week 1 |
| 1    | Monday                | 0 - 53              | The first week containing at least four days is week 1 |
| 2    | Sunday                | 1 - 53              | The first week containing Sunday is week 1 |
| 3    | Monday                | 1 - 53              | The first week containing at least four days is week 1 |
| 4    | Sunday                | 0 - 53              | The first week containing at least four days is week 1 |
| 5    | Monday                | 0 - 53              | The first week containing Monday is week 1 |
| 6    | Sunday                | 1 - 53              | The first week containing at least four days is week 1 |
| 7    | Monday                | 1 - 53              | The first week containing Monday is week 1 |

- When the return value range is 0 - 53, dates before the 1st week are considered week 0.
- When the return value range is 1 - 53, dates before the 1st week are considered the last week of the previous year.
- For example, with `2000-01-01`,
  - In `mode=0`, the return value is `0` because the first Sunday of that year is `2000-01-02`, making `2000-01-02` the start of week 1, thus `2000-01-01` is week 0, returning 0.
  - In `mode=1`, the return value is `0` because the week containing `2000-01-01` only has two days, `2000-01-01 (Saturday)` and `2000-01-02 (Sunday)`, making `2000-01-03` the start of the first week, thus `2000-01-01` is week 0, returning 0.
  - In `mode=2`, the return value is `52` because `2000-01-02` starts week 1, and with the return value range being 1-53, `2000-01-01` is considered the last week of the previous year, i.e., the 52nd week of 1999, returning 52.

**Example**:

```sql
taos> select week('2000-01-01',0);
 week('2000-01-01',0)  |
========================
                     0 |

taos> select week('2000-01-01',1);
 week('2000-01-01',1)  |
========================
                     0 |

taos> select week('2000-01-01',2);
 week('2000-01-01',2)  |
========================
                    52 |

taos> select week('2000-01-01',3);

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions return a single result row for each group of the result set of a query. Groups can be specified by a GROUP BY or window partition clause; if none is specified, the entire result set is considered a single group.

TDengine supports aggregate queries on data. The following aggregate functions are provided.

### APERCENTILE

```sql
APERCENTILE(expr, p [, algo_type])

algo_type: {
    "default"
  | "t-digest"
}
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the approximate percentile ranks of values in a specified column of a table/supertable, similar to the PERCENTILE function but returns an approximate result.

**Return Data Type**: DOUBLE.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Description**:

- The range of p is [0,100], where 0 is equivalent to MIN and 100 is equivalent to MAX.
- algo_type can be "default" or "t-digest". When the input is "default", the function uses a histogram-based algorithm for calculation. When the input is "t-digest", it uses the t-digest algorithm to calculate the approximate percentile. If algo_type is not specified, the "default" algorithm is used.
- The approximate result of the "t-digest" algorithm is sensitive to the order of input data, and different input orders may result in slight discrepancies in supertable queries.

### AVG

```sql
AVG(expr)
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the average value of the specified field.

**Return Data Type**: DOUBLE.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

### COUNT

```sql
COUNT({* | expr})
```

**Function Description**: Counts the number of record rows for the specified field.

**Return Data Type**: BIGINT.

**Applicable Data Types**: All field types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Notes**:

- An asterisk (*) can be used to replace a specific field, using an asterisk (*) returns the total number of records.
- If the counting field is a specific column, it returns the number of non-NULL value records in that column.

### ELAPSED

```sql
ELAPSED(ts_primary_key [, time_unit])
```

**Function Description**: The elapsed function expresses the continuous duration within the statistical period, and when used in conjunction with the twa function, it can calculate the area under the statistical curve. When specifying a window with the INTERVAL clause, it calculates the time range covered by data in each window within the given time range; if there is no INTERVAL clause, it returns the time range covered by data for the entire given time range. Note that ELAPSED does not return the absolute value of the time range, but the number of units obtained by dividing the absolute value by the time_unit. Stream computing only supports this function in FORCE_WINDOW_CLOSE mode.

**Return Result Type**: DOUBLE.

**Applicable Data Types**: TIMESTAMP.

**Applicable to**: Tables, supertables, outer queries of nested queries

**Notes**:

- The ts_primary_key parameter can only be the first column of the table, i.e., the TIMESTAMP type primary key column.
- Returns according to the time unit specified by the time_unit parameter, with the minimum being the time resolution of the database. If the time_unit parameter is not specified, the time resolution of the database is used as the time unit. Supported time units time_unit include:
          1b (nanosecond), 1u (microsecond), 1a (millisecond), 1s (second), 1m (minute), 1h (hour), 1d (day), 1w (week).
- Can be used in combination with interval, returning the timestamp difference for each time window. It is important to note that, except for the first and last time windows, the timestamp differences for the middle windows are all the length of the window.
- order by asc/desc does not affect the calculation of the difference.
- For supertables, it needs to be used in combination with the group by tbname clause, and cannot be used directly.
- For regular tables, it is not supported in combination with the group by clause.
- For nested queries, it is only valid when the inner query outputs an implicit timestamp column. For example, the statement select elapsed(ts) from (select diff(value) from sub1), the diff function causes the inner query to output an implicit timestamp column, which is the primary key column and can be used as the first parameter of the elapsed function. Conversely, for example, the statement select elapsed(ts) from (select * from sub1), the ts column output to the outer layer no longer has the meaning of the primary key column and cannot use the elapsed function. Additionally, as a function strongly dependent on the timeline, forms like select elapsed(ts) from (select diff(value) from st group by tbname) although will return a calculation result, it has no practical significance, and such usage will also be restricted in the future.
- Not supported in combination with leastsquares, diff, derivative, top, bottom, last_row, interp, and other functions.

### LEASTSQUARES

```sql
LEASTSQUARES(expr, start_val, step_val)
```

```

**Function Description**:

- Uses the hyperloglog algorithm to return the cardinality of a column. This algorithm significantly reduces memory usage with large data volumes, providing an estimated cardinality with a standard error of 0.81%.
- For smaller data volumes, this algorithm may not be very accurate. Alternatively, use `select count(data) from (select unique(col) as data from table)`.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric fields.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Detailed Description**:

- bin_type: User-specified bucket type, valid inputs are "user_input", "linear_bin", "log_bin".
- bin_description: Describes how to generate bucket intervals, for the three types of buckets, the descriptions are as follows (all in JSON format strings):
  - "user_input": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"
       User specifies the exact values for bins.

  - "linear_bin": "\{"start": 0.0, "width": 5.0, "count": 5, "infinity": true}"
       "start" indicates the starting point of data, "width" indicates the offset for each bin, "count" is the total number of bins, "infinity" indicates whether to add (-inf, inf) as the interval start and end points,
       generating intervals as [-inf, 0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, +inf].

  - "log_bin": "\{"start":1.0, "factor": 2.0, "count": 5, "infinity": true}"
       "start" indicates the starting point of data, "factor" indicates the exponential growth factor, "count" is the total number of bins, "infinity" indicates whether to add (-inf, inf) as the interval start and end points,
       generating intervals as [-inf, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, +inf].
- normalized: Whether to normalize the results to between 0 and 1. Valid inputs are 0 and 1.

### PERCENTILE

```sql
PERCENTILE(expr, p [, p1] ... )
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the percentile values for a column in a table.

**Return Data Type**: The function requires a minimum of 2 parameters and can accept up to 11 parameters. It can return up to 10 percentile values at once. When the number of parameters is 2, it returns one percentile as a DOUBLE. When the number of parameters is more than 2, it returns a VARCHAR type, formatted as a JSON array containing multiple return values.

**Applicable Fields**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- *P* values range from 0≤*P*≤100, where P=0 is equivalent to MIN and P=100 is equivalent to MAX;
- When calculating multiple percentiles for the same column, it is recommended to use one PERCENTILE function with multiple parameters to significantly reduce the response time of the query.
  For example, using the query SELECT percentile(col, 90, 95, 99) FROM table performs better than SELECT percentile(col, 90), percentile(col, 95), percentile(col, 99) from table.

## Selection Functions

Selection functions choose one or more rows from the query result set based on semantics. Users can specify the output of the ts column or other columns (including tbname and tag columns), making it easy to know which data row the selected values originate from.

### BOTTOM

```sql
BOTTOM(expr, k)
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the smallest *k* non-NULL values of a column in a table/supertable. If multiple data entries have the same value and exceed the limit of k entries, the system randomly selects the required number of entries from those with the same value.

**Return Data Type**: Same as the applied field.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- *k* value range is 1≤*k*≤100;
- The system also returns the associated timestamp column;
- Limitation: BOTTOM function does not support the FILL clause.

### FIRST

```sql
FIRST(expr)
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the first non-NULL value written in a column of a table/supertable.

**Return Data Type**: Same as the applied field.

**Applicable Data Types**: All fields.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- To return the first non-NULL value of each column (smallest timestamp), use FIRST(\*); when querying a supertable, and if multiResultFunctionStarReturnTags is set to 0 (default), FIRST(\*) only returns the normal columns of the supertable; if set to 1, it returns both the normal and tag columns of the supertable.
- If all values in a column in the result set are NULL, the return for that column is also NULL;
- If all columns in the result set are NULL, no results are returned.
- For tables with composite primary keys, if there are multiple entries with the smallest timestamp, only the data with the smallest composite primary key is returned.

### INTERP

```sql
INTERP(expr [, ignore_null_values])

ignore_null_values: {
    0
  | 1
}
```

**Function Description**: Returns the record value or interpolated value of a specified column at a specified time slice. The ignore_null_values parameter can be 0 or 1, where 1 means to ignore NULL values, default is 0.

**Return Data Type**: Same as the field type.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**

- INTERP is used to obtain the record value of a specified column at a specified time slice. If there is no row data that meets the conditions at that time slice, interpolation will be performed according to the settings of the FILL parameter.
- The input data for INTERP is the data of the specified column, which can be filtered through conditional statements (where clause). If no filtering condition is specified, the input is all data.
- INTERP SQL queries need to be used together with the RANGE, EVERY, and FILL keywords; stream computing cannot use RANGE, needs EVERY and FILL keywords together.
- The output time range for INTERP is specified by the RANGE(timestamp1, timestamp2) field, which must satisfy timestamp1 \<= timestamp2. Here, timestamp1 is the start value of the output time range, i.e., if the conditions for interpolation are met at timestamp1, then timestamp1 is the first record output, and timestamp2 is the end value of the output time range, i.e., the timestamp of the last record output cannot be greater than timestamp2.
- INTERP determines the number of results within the output time range based on the EVERY(time_unit) field, starting from timestamp1 and interpolating at fixed intervals of time (time_unit value), where time_unit can be time units: 1a (milliseconds), 1s (seconds), 1m (minutes), 1h (hours), 1d (days), 1w (weeks). For example, EVERY(500a) will interpolate the specified data every 500 milliseconds.
- INTERP determines how to interpolate at each time point that meets the output conditions based on the FILL field. For how to use the FILL clause, refer to [FILL Clause](../time-series-extensions/)
- INTERP can interpolate at a single time point specified in the RANGE field, in which case the EVERY field can be omitted. For example: SELECT INTERP(col) FROM tb RANGE('2023-01-01 00:00:00') FILL(linear).
- When INTERP is applied to a supertable, it will sort all the subtable data under that supertable by primary key column and perform interpolation calculations, and can also be used with PARTITION BY tbname to force the results to a single timeline.
- INTERP can be used with the pseudocolumn _irowts to return the timestamp corresponding to the interpolation point (supported from version 3.0.2.0).
- INTERP can be used with the pseudocolumn _isfilled to display whether the return result is from the original record or generated by the interpolation algorithm (supported from version 3.0.3.0).
- For queries on tables with composite primary keys, if there are data with the same timestamp, only the data with the smallest composite primary key participates in the calculation.
- INTERP query supports NEAR FILL mode, i.e., when FILL is needed, it uses the data closest to the current time point for interpolation. When the timestamps before and after are equally close to the current time slice, FILL the previous row's value. This mode is not supported in stream computing and window queries. For example: SELECT INTERP(col) FROM tb RANGE('2023-01-01 00:00:00', '2023-01-01 00:10:00') FILL(NEAR).(Supported from version 3.3.4.9).
- INTERP can only use the pseudocolumn `_irowts_origin` when using FILL PREV/NEXT/NEAR modes. `_irowts_origin` is supported from version 3.3.4.9.
- INTERP `RANGE` clause supports the expansion of the time range (supported from version 3.3.4.9), such as `RANGE('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 10s)` means to find data 10s before and after the time point '2023-01-01 00:00:00' for interpolation, FILL PREV/NEXT/NEAR respectively means to look for data forward/backward/around the time point, if there is no data around the time point, then use the value specified by FILL for interpolation, therefore the FILL clause must specify a value at this time. For example: SELECT INTERP(col) FROM tb RANGE('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 10s) FILL(PREV, 1). Currently, only the combination of time point and time range is supported, not the combination of time interval and time range, i.e., RANGE('2023-01-01 00:00:00', '2023-02-01 00:00:00', 1h) is not supported. The specified time range rules are similar to EVERY, the unit cannot be year or month, the value cannot be 0, and cannot have quotes. When using this extension, other FILL modes except FILL PREV/NEXT/NEAR are not supported, and the EVERY clause cannot be specified.

### LAST

```sql
LAST(expr)
```

**Function Description**: Returns the last non-NULL value written in a column of a table/supertable.

**Return Data Type**: Same as the applied field.

**Applicable Data Types**: All fields.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- To return the last (timestamp largest) non-NULL value of each column, you can use LAST(\*); when querying a supertable, and if multiResultFunctionStarReturnTags is set to 0 (default), LAST(\*) only returns the normal columns of the supertable; if set to 1, it returns both the normal and tag columns of the supertable.
- If all values in a column in the result set are NULL, the return result for that column is also NULL; if all columns in the result set are NULL, no result is returned.
- When used with supertables, if there are multiple rows with the same timestamp and it is the largest, one will be randomly returned, and it is not guaranteed that the same row will be selected in multiple runs.
- For tables with composite primary keys, if there are multiple records with the maximum timestamp, only the data with the largest corresponding composite primary key is returned.

### LAST_ROW

```

**Function Description**: Returns the last k records after skipping the last offset_val records, not ignoring NULL values. offset_val can be omitted. In this case, it returns the last k records. When offset_val is provided, the function is equivalent to `order by ts desc LIMIT k OFFSET offset_val`.

**Parameter Range**: k: [1,100] offset_val: [0,100].

**Return Data Type**: Same as the applied field.

**Applicable to**: Tables, supertables.

### TOP

```sql
TOP(expr, k)
```

- `2` means do not ignore (diff result) negative values but ignore null values
- `3` means ignore (diff result) negative values and ignore null values
- For queries on tables with composite primary keys, if there are multiple records with the same timestamp, only the data with the smallest composite primary key is involved in the calculation.

**Return Data Type**: For bool, timestamp, and integer value types, returns int_64; for floating-point types, returns double; if the diff result overflows, it returns the overflowed value.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types, timestamp, and bool types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

**Usage Instructions**:

- diff calculates the difference between the specific column of the current row and the previous valid data of the same column, where the previous valid data refers to the nearest non-null value in the same column with a smaller timestamp.
- For numeric types, the diff result is the corresponding arithmetic difference; for timestamp types, the difference is calculated based on the timestamp precision of the database; for bool types, true is considered as 1, and false as 0
- If the current row data is null or no previous valid data is found in the same column, the diff result is null
- When ignoring negative values (ignore_option set to 1 or 3), if the diff result is negative, the result is set to null, then filtered according to the null value filtering rules
- When the diff result overflows, whether the result is `a negative value to be ignored` depends on whether the logical operation result is positive or negative, for example, the value of 9223372036854775800 - (-9223372036854775806) exceeds the range of BIGINT, the diff result will show the overflow value -10, but it will not be ignored as a negative value
- A single statement can use one or multiple diffs, and each diff can specify the same or different ignore_option; when there is more than one diff in a single statement, only when all diff results of a row are null and all ignore_options are set to ignore null values, the row is excluded from the result set
- Can be used with associated columns. For example: select _rowts, DIFF() from.
- When there is no composite primary key, if different subtables have data with the same timestamp, a "Duplicate timestamps not allowed" message will be displayed
- When using composite primary keys, the timestamp and primary key combinations of different subtables may be the same, which row is used depends on which one is found first, meaning that the results of running diff() multiple times in this situation may vary.

### IRATE

```sql
IRATE(expr)
```

**Function Description**: Calculates the instantaneous growth rate. It uses the last two sample data points in the time interval to calculate the instantaneous growth rate; if these two values are decreasing, then only the last value is used for the calculation, rather than the difference between the two. For queries on tables with composite primary keys, if there are multiple data points with the same timestamp, only the data corresponding to the smallest composite primary key is used in the calculation.

**Return Data Type**: DOUBLE.

**Applicable Data Types**: Numeric types.

**Applicable to**: Tables and supertables.

### MAVG

### STATEDURATION

```sql
STATEDURATION(expr, oper, val, unit)
```

**Function Description**: Returns the duration of time for consecutive records that meet a certain condition, with the result appended as a new column to each row. The condition is calculated based on the parameters, adding the time length between two records if the condition is true (the time length of the first record meeting the condition is counted as 0), resetting to -1 if false, and skipping the data if it is NULL.

**Parameter Range**:

- oper: `'LT'` (less than), `'GT'` (greater than), `'LE'` (less than or equal to), `'GE'` (greater than or equal to), `'NE'` (not equal to), `'EQ'` (equal to), case insensitive, but must be enclosed in `''`.

## System Information Functions

### DATABASE

```sql
SELECT DATABASE();
```

**Description**: Returns the currently logged-in database. If no default database was specified at login and the USE command has not been used to switch databases, it returns NULL.

### CLIENT_VERSION

```sql
SELECT CLIENT_VERSION();
