## SHOW TABLE DISTRIBUTED

```sql
SHOW TABLE DISTRIBUTED table_name;
```

<summary>Display Example</summary>

```text
*************************** 1.row ***************************

_block_dist: Total_Blocks=[5] Total_Size=[93.65 KB] Average_size=[18.73 KB] Compression_Ratio=[23.98 %]

Total_Blocks:  The number of blocks occupied by table d0 is 5.

Total_Size:    The size of all blocks occupied by table d0 in files is 93.65 KB.

Average_size:  The average space occupied by each block in files is 18.73 KB.

Compression_Ratio: Data compression ratio 23.98%.


*************************** 2.row ***************************

_block_dist: Total_Rows=[20000] Inmem_Rows=[0] MinRows=[3616] MaxRows=[4096] Average_Rows=[4000]

Total_Rows:  The number of rows stored on disk for table d0 is 20000 (this value is for reference only and is not an accurate count. To get an accurate count, the count function should be used).

Inmem_Rows: The number of data rows stored in write cache (not yet on disk), 0 rows indicates that there is no data in the memory cache.

MinRows:    The minimum number of rows in a BLOCK is 3616.

MaxRows:    The maximum number of rows in a BLOCK is 4096.

Average_Rows: The average number of rows in each BLOCK at this time is 4000.


*************************** 3.row ***************************

_block_dist: Total_Tables=[1] Total_Files=[2] Total_Vgroups=[1]

Total_Tables:   The number of sub-tables, which is 1 here.

Total_Files: The number of data files where the table's data is stored separately, here it is 2 files.

Total_Vgroups: The number of virtual nodes (vnodes) that distribute the table's data.


*************************** 5.row ***************************

_block_dist: 0100 | 

*************************** 6.row ***************************

_block_dist: 0299 | 

......

*************************** 22.row ***************************

_block_dist: 3483 |||||||||||||||||  1 (20.00%)

*************************** 23.row ***************************

_block_dist: 3682 | 

*************************** 24.row ***************************

_block_dist: 3881 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  4 (80.00%)

Query OK, 24 row(s) in set (0.002444s)
```

</details>

The above shows the distribution of blocks containing the number of data rows. Here, 0100 0299 0498 â€¦ indicates the number of data rows in each block. The meaning above is that among the 5 blocks of this table, the block that distributes between 3483 and 3681 has 1 block, occupying 20% of the total blocks, and the blocks that distribute between 3881 and 4096 (the maximum number of rows) is 4 blocks, occupying 80% of the total blocks, while the number of blocks distributed in other areas is 0.

It is important to note that only the data block information in the data files will be displayed here; information in the stt files will not be displayed.

## SHOW TAGS

```sql
SHOW TAGS FROM child_table_name [FROM db_name];
SHOW TAGS FROM [db_name.]child_table_name;
```

Displays tag information of the subtable.

## SHOW TOPICS

```sql
SHOW TOPICS;
```

Displays information about all topics in the current database.

## SHOW TRANSACTIONS

```sql

```

Displays information about all users in the current system, including user-defined users and system default users.

## SHOW CLUSTER VARIABLES (before version 3.0.1.6 it was SHOW VARIABLES)

```sql
SHOW CLUSTER VARIABLES;
SHOW DNODE dnode_id VARIABLES;
```

Displays the running values of configuration parameters that need to be the same across nodes in the current system, and you can specify DNODE to view its configuration parameters.

```

Displays information about all VGROUPs in the current database.

## SHOW VNODES

```sql
SHOW VNODES [ON DNODE dnode_id];
```
