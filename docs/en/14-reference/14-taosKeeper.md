## Introduction

taosKeeper is a tool for TDengine that exports monitoring metrics. With taosKeeper, you can easily monitor the operational status of your TDengine deployment. taosKeeper uses the TDengine REST API. It is not necessary to install TDengine Client to use taosKeeper.

## Installation

There are two ways to install taosKeeper:
Methods of installing taosKeeper:

- Installing the official TDengine installer will automatically install taosKeeper. Please refer to [TDengine installation](/operation/pkg-install) for details.

- You can compile taosKeeper separately and install it. Please refer to the [taosKeeper](https://github.com/taosdata/taoskeeper) repository for details.
## Configuration and Launch

### Configuration

taosKeeper needs to be executed on the terminal of the operating system, it supports three configuration methods: [Command-line arguments](#command-line-arguments-in-detail), [environment variable](#environment-variable-in-detail) and [configuration file](#configuration-file-parameters-in-detail). The precedence of those is Command-line, environment variable and configuration file.

**Make sure that the TDengine cluster is running correctly before running taosKeeper.** Ensure that the monitoring service in TDengine has been started. At least the values of `monitor` and `monitorFqdn` need to be set in `taos.cfg`.

```shell
monitor 1
monitorFqdn localhost # taoskeeper's FQDN
```

For more information, see [TDengine Monitoring Configuration](../config/#monitoring).

### Quick Launch

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux" value="linux">

After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the taoskeeper service:

```bash
systemctl start taoskeeper
```

Run the following command to confirm that taoskeeper is running normally:

```bash
systemctl status taoskeeper
```

Output similar to the following indicates that taoskeeper is running normally:

```
Active: active (running)
```

Output similar to the following indicates that taoskeeper has not started successfully:

```
Active: inactive (dead)
```

The following `systemctl` commands can help you manage taoskeeper service:

- Start taoskeeper Server: `systemctl start taoskeeper`

- Stop taoskeeper Server: `systemctl stop taoskeeper`

- Restart taoskeeper Server: `systemctl restart taoskeeper`

- Check taoskeeper Server status: `systemctl status taoskeeper`

:::info

- The `systemctl` command requires _root_ privileges. If you are not logged in as the _root_ user, use the `sudo` command.
- The `systemctl stop taoskeeper` command will instantly stop taoskeeper Server.
- If your system does not include `systemd`, you can run `/usr/local/taos/bin/taoskeeper` to start taoskeeper manually.

<TabItem label="macOS" value="macos">

After the installation is complete, run `launchctl start com.tdengine.taoskeeper` to start taoskeeper Server.

The following `launchctl` commands can help you manage taoskeeper service:

- Start taoskeeper Server: `sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taoskeeper`

- Stop taoskeeper Server: `sudo launchctl stop com.tdengine.taoskeeper`

- Check taoskeeper Server status: `sudo launchctl list | grep taoskeeper`

:::info
- Please use `sudo` to run `launchctl` to manage _com.tdengine.taoskeeper_ with administrator privileges.
- The administrator privilege is required for service management to enhance security.
- Troubleshooting:
- The first column returned by the command `launchctl list | grep taoskeeper` is the PID of the program. If it's `-`, that means the taoskeeper service is not running.
- If the service is abnormal, please check the `launchd.log` file from the system log.

#### Launch With Configuration File

You can quickly launch taosKeeper with the following commands. If you do not specify a configuration file, `/etc/taos/keeper.toml` is used by default. If this file does not specify configurations, the default values are used.

```shell
$ taoskeeper -c <keeper config file>
```

**Sample configuration files**
```toml
# enable debug in gin framework
debug = false

# listen to server port, default 6043
port = 6043

# set log level to panic, error, info, debug, or trace
loglevel = "info"

# set pool size
gopoolsize = 50000

# query rotation period for TDengine monitoring data
RotationInterval = "15s"

[tdengine]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 6041
username = "root"
password = "taosdata"

# set taosAdapter to monitor
[taosAdapter]
address = ["127.0.0.1:6041","192.168.1.95:6041"]

[metrics]
# monitoring metric prefix
prefix = "taos"

# cluster data identifier
cluster = "production"

# database to store monitoring data
database = "log"

# standard tables to monitor
tables = ["normal_table"]
```

### Obtain Monitoring Metrics

taosKeeper records monitoring metrics generated by TDengine in a specified database and provides an interface through which you can export the data.

#### View Monitoring Results

```shell
$ taos
# the log database is used in this example
> use log;
> select * from cluster_info limit 1;
```

```shell
