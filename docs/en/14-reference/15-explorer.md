## Install

## Configure

The configuration file of `taos-explorer` service is `/etc/taos/explorer.toml` on Linux platform, the key items in the configuration are like below:

``` toml
port = 6060
cluster = "http://localhost:6041"
```

The description of these two parameters: 

- port：taos-explorer service port
- cluster：The end point of the TDengine cluster for the taos-explorer to manage. It supports only websocket connection, so this address is actually the end point of `taosAdapter` service in the TDengine cluster.

## Start & Stop

Before starting the service, please first make sure the configuration is correct, and the TDengine cluster (majorly including `taosd` and `taosAdapter` services) are already alive and working well.
