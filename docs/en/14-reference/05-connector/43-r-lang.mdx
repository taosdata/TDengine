By using the RJDBC library in R, R programs can access data from TDengine. Below are the installation process, configuration steps, and R code examples.

## Installation Process

Before you start, ensure that you have the R language environment installed. Then follow these steps to install and configure the RJDBC library:

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK): The RJDBC library requires a Java environment. Please download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the Oracle official website and follow the installation guide.

2. Install the RJDBC library: Execute the following command in the R console to install the RJDBC library.

   ```r
   install.packages("RJDBC", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
   ```

   :::note

   1. The R language software version 4.2 that comes with Ubuntu may produce a non-responsive bug when calling the RJDBC library. Please install the R language package from the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/).
   2. Installing the RJDBC package on Linux may require installing additional components. For example, on Ubuntu, execute the command `apt install -y libbz2-dev libpcre2-dev libicu-dev` to install.
   3. On Windows systems, you need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

   :::

3. Download the TDengine JDBC driver: Visit maven.org to download the TDengine JDBC driver (taos-jdbcdriver-X.X.X-dist.jar).

4. Place the TDengine JDBC driver in an appropriate location: Choose a suitable location on your computer to save the TDengine JDBC driver file (taos-jdbcdriver-X.X.X-dist.jar).

## Configuration Process

After completing the installation steps, you need to configure some settings so that the RJDBC library can correctly connect to and access the TDengine time-series database.

1. Load the RJDBC and other necessary libraries in your R script:

   ```r
   library(DBI)
   library(rJava)
   library(RJDBC)
   ```

2. Set the JDBC driver and JDBC URL:

   ```r
   # Set the path to the JDBC driver (modify based on your actual storage location)
   driverPath <- "/path/to/taos-jdbcdriver-X.X.X-dist.jar"

   # Set the JDBC URL (modify based on your specific environment)
   url <- "jdbc:TAOS://localhost:6030/?user=root&password=taosdata"
   ```

3. Load the JDBC driver:

   ```r
   # Load the JDBC driver
   drv <- JDBC("com.taosdata.jdbc.TSDBDriver", driverPath)
   ```

4. Create a TDengine database connection:

   ```r
   # Create the database connection
   conn <- dbConnect(drv, url)
   ```

5. Once connected successfully, you can perform various database operations with the `conn` object, such as querying data, inserting data, etc.

6. Finally, don't forget to close the database connection when you're done using it:

   ```r
   # Close the database connection
   dbDisconnect(conn)
   ```

## R Language Example Code Using RJDBC

Here is an example code snippet that connects to the TDengine time-series database using the RJDBC library and executes a query:

<Rdemo/>

Please modify the JDBC driver, JDBC URL, username, password, and SQL query statement according to your actual TDengine time-series database environment and requirements.

By following the above steps and example code, you can access the TDengine time-series database using the RJDBC library in the R language environment for data querying and analysis operations.
