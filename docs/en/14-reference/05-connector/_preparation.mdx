- The client driver has been installed (installation is required for native connections; REST connections do not require installation).

:::info

Since TDengine's client driver is written in C, when using native connections, the corresponding client driver shared library file installed on the local system needs to be loaded, which is usually included in the TDengine installation package. The TDengine Linux server installation package comes with the TDengine client, or you can install the [Linux client](../get-started/) separately. When developing in a Windows environment, you need to install the corresponding [Windows client](https://www.taosdata.com/cn/all-downloads/#TDengine-Windows-Client).

- **libtaos.so**: After successfully installing TDengine on a Linux system, the dependent Linux client driver `libtaos.so` file will be automatically copied to `/usr/lib/libtaos.so`, which is included in the Linux automatic scan path and does not need to be specified separately.
- **taos.dll**: After installing the client on a Windows system, the dependent Windows client driver `taos.dll` file will be automatically copied to the system's default search path `C:/Windows/System32`, and it also does not need to be specified separately.
- **libtaos.dylib**: After successfully installing TDengine on a macOS system, the dependent macOS client driver `libtaos.dylib` file will be automatically copied to `/usr/local/lib/libtaos.dylib`, which is included in the macOS automatic scan path and does not need to be specified separately.
