title: Third Party Tools
description: This document describes how to integrate TDengine with various third-party tools.

Since TDengine supports standard SQL commands, common database connector standards (e.g., JDBC), ORM, and other popular time-series database writing protocols (e.g., InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB JSON, OpenTSDB Telnet, etc.), it is very easy to integrate TDengine with other third party tools. You only need to provide simple configuration, the integration can be done without a line of code. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
