TDengine™ is a time-series database purpose-built for Industry 4.0 and Industrial IoT. It enables real-time ingestion, storage, analysis, and distribution of petabytes of data per day, generated by billions of sensors and data collectors. TDengine's mission is to make time-series data accessible, valuable, and affordable for everyone — from independent developers and startups to industry stalwarts and multinationals.

This website contains the user documentation for TDengine:

- If you are new to time-series data, you can get a quick understanding of the field from ["What Is a Time-Series Database?"](https://tdengine.com/what-is-a-time-series-database/) and [other articles](https://tdengine.com/time-series-database/) on our official website.
- If you would like to install TDengine and experience its features for yourself, see the [Get Started](get-started/) section for instructions.
- System architects are advised to review the [Basic Features](basic-features/) and [Advanced Features](advanced-features/) sections to decide whether TDengine's capabilities can meet their needs, as well as [Inside TDengine](inside-tdengine/) for a more in-depth look at TDengine's design.
- Software developers can consult the [Developer's Guide](developer-guide/) for information about creating applications that interoperate with TDengine and writing user-defined functions that run within TDengine.
- Database administrators will find valuable information in [Operations and Maintenance](operations-and-maintenance/) and [TDengine Reference](tdengine-reference/) to assist in managing, maintaining, and monitoring their TDengine deployments.
