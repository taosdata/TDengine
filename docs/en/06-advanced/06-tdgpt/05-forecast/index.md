Time-series forecasting takes a continuous period of time-series data as its input and forecasts how the data will trend in the next continuous period. The number of data points in the forecast results is not fixed, but can be specified by the user. TDgpt uses the `FORECAST` function to provide forecasting. The input for this function is the historical time-series data used as a basis for forecasting, and the output is forecast data. You can use the `FORECAST` function to invoke a forecasting algorithm on an anode to provide service. Forecasting is typically performed on a subtable or on the same time series across tables.

In this section, the table `foo` is used as an example to describe how to perform forecasting and anomaly detection in TDgpt. This table is described as follows:

| Column | Type | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------- |
|ts|timestamp|Primary timestamp|
|i32|int32|Metric generated by a device as a 4-byte integer|

```sql
taos> select * from foo;
           ts            |      i32    |

### Syntax

```SQL
FORECAST(column_expr, option_expr)

option_expr: {"
algo=expr1
[,wncheck=1|0]
[,conf=conf_val]
[,every=every_val]
[,rows=rows_val]
[,start=start_ts_val]
[,expr2]
"}
```

1. `column_expr`: The time-series data column to forecast. Enter a column whose data type is numerical.
1. `options`: The parameters for forecasting. Enter parameters in key=value format, separating multiple parameters with a comma (,). It is not necessary to use quotation marks or escape characters. Only ASCII characters are supported. The supported parameters are described as follows:

### Parameter Description

|Parameter|Definition|Default|
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
|algo|Forecasting algorithm.|holtwinters|
|wncheck|White noise data check. Enter 1 to enable or 0 to disable.|1|
|conf|Confidence interval for forecast data. Enter an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.|95|
|every|Sampling period.|The sampling period of the input data|
|start|Starting timestamp for forecast data.|One sampling period after the final timestamp in the input data|
|rows|Number of forecast rows to return.|10|

- Three pseudocolumns are used in forecasting:
  - `_FROWTS`: the timestamp of the forecast data
  - `_FLOW`: the lower threshold of the confidence interval
  - `_FHIGH`: the upper threshold of the confidence interval. For algorithms that do not include a confidence interval, the `_FLOW` and `_FHIGH` pseudocolumns contain the forecast results.
- You can specify the `START` parameter to modify the starting time of forecast results. This does not affect the forecast values, only the time range.
- The `EVERY` parameter can be lesser than or equal to the sampling period of the input data. However, it cannot be greater than the sampling period of the input data.
- If you specify a confidence interval for an algorithm that does not use it, the upper and lower thresholds of the confidence interval regress to a single point.
- The maximum value of rows is 1024. If you specify a higher value, only 1024 rows are returned.
- The maximum size of the input historical data is 40,000 rows. Note that some models may have stricter limitations.

### Example

```SQL
--- ARIMA forecast, return 10 rows of results (default), perform white noise data check, with 95% confidence interval 
SELECT  _flow, _fhigh, _frowts, FORECAST(i32, "algo=arima")
FROM foo;

--- ARIMA forecast, periodic input data, 10 samples per period, disable white noise data check, with 95% confidence interval
SELECT  _flow, _fhigh, _frowts, FORECAST(i32, "algo=arima,alpha=95,period=10,wncheck=0")
FROM foo;
```

```sql
taos> select _flow, _fhigh, _frowts, forecast(i32) from foo;
        _flow         |        _fhigh        |       _frowts           | forecast(i32) |

## Evaluating Algorithm Effectiveness

TDengine Enterprise includes `analytics_compare`, a tool that evaluates the effectiveness of time-series forecasting algorithms in TDgpt. You can configure this tool to perform backtesting on data stored in TDengine and determine which algorithms and models are most effective for your data. The evaluation is based on mean squared error (MSE). MAE and MAPE are in development.

The configuration of the evaluation tool is described as follows:

```ini
[forecast]
# number of data points per training period
period = 10

# consider final 10 rows of in-scope data as forecasting results
rows = 10

# start time of training data
start_time = 1949-01-01T00:00:00

# end time of training data
end_time = 1960-12-01T00:00:00

# start time of results
res_start_time = 1730000000000

# specify whether to create a graphical chart
gen_figure = true
```

To use the tool, run `analytics_compare` in TDgpt's `misc` directory. Ensure that you run the tool on a machine with a Python environment installed. You can test the tool as follows:

1. Configure your TDengine cluster information in the `analytics.ini` file:

```ini
[taosd]
# taosd hostname
host = 127.0.0.1

# username
user = root

# password
password = taosdata

# tdengine configuration file
conf = /etc/taos/taos.cfg

[input_data]
# database for testing forecasting algorithms
db_name = test

# table with test data
table_name = passengers

# columns with test data
column_name = val, _c0   
```

1. Prepare your data.

A sample data file `sample-fc.sql` is included in the `resource` directory. Run the following command to ingest the sample data into TDengine:

```shell
taos -f sample-fc.sql
```

You can now begin the evaluation.

1. Ensure that the Python environment on the local machine is operational. Then run the following command:

```shell
python3.10 ./analytics_compare.py forecast
```

1. The evaluation results are written to `fc_result.xlsx`. The first card shows the results, shown as follows, including the algorithm name, parameters, mean square error, and elapsed time.

| algorithm   | params                                                                    | MSE     | elapsed_time(ms.) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| holtwinters | `{"trend":"add", "seasonal":"add"}`                                       | 351.622 | 125.1721          |
| arima       | `{"time_step":3600000, "start_p":0, "max_p":10, "start_q":0, "max_q":10}` | 433.709 | 45577.9187        |

If you set `gen_figure` to `true`, a chart is also generated, as displayed in the following figure.
