This section describes how to create data migration tasks through the Explorer interface, synchronizing data from an OPC-DA server to the current TDengine cluster.

## Overview

OPC is one of the interoperability standards for secure and reliable data exchange in the field of industrial automation and other industries.

OPC DA (Data Access) is a classic COM-based specification, only applicable to Windows. Although OPC DA is not the latest and most efficient data communication specification, it is widely used. This is mainly because some old equipment only supports OPC DA.

TDengine can efficiently read data from OPC-DA servers and write it to TDengine, achieving real-time data storage.

## Creating a Task

### 1. Add a Data Source

On the data writing page, click the **+Add Data Source** button to enter the add data source page.

### 2. Configure Basic Information

Enter the task name in **Name**, for example, for environmental temperature and humidity monitoring, name it **environment-monitoring**.

Select **OPC-DA** from the **Type** dropdown list.

If the taosX service is running on the same server as OPC-DA, **Proxy** is not necessary; otherwise, configure **Proxy**: select a specified proxy from the dropdown, or click the **+Create New Proxy** button on the right to create a new proxy and follow the prompts to configure the proxy.

Select a target database from the **Target Database** dropdown list, or click the **+Create Database** button on the right to create a new database.

### 3. Configure Connection Information

Fill in the **OPC-DA Service Address** in the **Connection Configuration** area, for example: `127.0.0.1/Matrikon.OPC.Simulation.1`, and configure the authentication method.

Click the **Connectivity Check** button to check if the data source is available.

### 4. Configure Points Set

**Points Set** can choose to use a CSV file template or **Select All Points**.

#### 4.1. Upload CSV Configuration File

You can download the CSV blank template and configure the point information according to the template, then upload the CSV configuration file to configure the points; or download the data points according to the configured filter conditions, and download them in the format specified by the CSV template.

CSV files have the following rules:

1. File Encoding

The encoding format of the CSV file uploaded by the user must be one of the following:

(1) UTF-8 with BOM

(2) UTF-8 (i.e., UTF-8 without BOM)

2. Header Configuration Rules

The header is the first line of the CSV file, with the following rules:

(1) The header of the CSV can configure the following columns:

| No. | Column Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Required | Default Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Where `tag` is a reserved keyword, indicating that this column is a tag column; `VARCHAR(200)` indicates the type of this tag, which can also be other legal types; `name` is the actual name of this tag. | No       | If configuring more than one tag column, use the configured tag columns; if no tag columns are configured, and stable exists in TDengine, use the tags of the stable in TDengine; if no tag columns are configured, and stable does not exist in TDengine, automatically add the following two tag columns by default: tag::VARCHAR(256)::point_idtag::VARCHAR(256)::point_name |

(2) In the CSV Header, there cannot be duplicate columns;

(3) In the CSV Header, columns like `tag::VARCHAR(200)::name` can be configured multiple times, corresponding to multiple Tags in TDengine, but the names of the Tags cannot be duplicated.

(4) In the CSV Header, the order of columns does not affect the CSV file validation rules;

(5) In the CSV Header, columns that are not listed in the table above, such as: serial number, will be automatically ignored.

3. Row Configuration Rules

Each Row in the CSV file configures an OPC data point. The rules for Rows are as follows:

(1) Correspondence with columns in the Header

| Number | Column in Header        | Type of Value | Range of Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Mandatory | Default Value            |

(2) `tag_name` is unique throughout the DataIn task, that is: in an OPC DataIn task, a data point can only be written to one subtable in TDengine. If you need to write a data point to multiple subtables, you need to create multiple OPC DataIn tasks;

(3) When `tag_name` is different but `tbname` is the same, `value_col` must be different. This configuration allows data from multiple data points of different types to be written to different columns in the same subtable. This corresponds to the "OPC data into TDengine wide table" scenario.

4. Other Rules

(1) If the number of columns in Header and Row are not consistent, validation fails, and the user is prompted with the line number that does not meet the requirements;

(2) Header is on the first line and cannot be empty;

(3) Row must have more than 1 line;

#### 4.2. Selecting Data Points

Data points can be filtered by configuring the **Root Node ID** and **Regular Expression**.

Configure **Supertable Name** and **Table Name** to specify the supertable and subtable where the data will be written.

Configure **Primary Key Column**, choosing `origin_ts` to use the original timestamp of the OPC data point as the primary key in TDengine; choosing `request_ts` to use the timestamp when the data is request as the primary key; choosing `received_ts` to use the timestamp when the data is received as the primary key. Configure **Primary Key Alias** to specify the name of the TDengine timestamp column.

### 5. Collection Configuration

In the collection configuration, set the current task's collection interval, connection timeout, and collection timeout.

<figure>
<Image img={imgStep5} alt=""/>
</figure>

As shown in the image:

- **Connection Timeout**: Configures the timeout for connecting to the OPC server, default is 10 seconds.
- **Collection Timeout**: If data is not returned from the OPC server within the set time during data point reading, the read fails, default is 10 seconds.
- **Collection Interval**: Default is 10 seconds, the interval for data point collection, starting from the end of the last data collection, polling to read the latest value of the data point and write it into TDengine.

When using **Select Data Points** in the **Data Point Set**, the collection configuration can configure **Data Point Update Mode** and **Data Point Update Interval** to enable dynamic data point updates. **Dynamic Data Point Update** means that during the task operation, if OPC Server adds or deletes data points, the matching data points will automatically be added to the current task without needing to restart the OPC task.

- Data Point Update Mode: Can choose `None`, `Append`, `Update`.
  - None: Do not enable dynamic data point updates;
  - Append: Enable dynamic data point updates, but only append;
  - Update: Enable dynamic data point updates, append or delete;
- Data Point Update Interval: Effective when "Data Point Update Mode" is `Append` and `Update`. Unit: seconds, default value is 600, minimum value: 60, maximum value: 2147483647.

### 6. Advanced Options

<figure>
<Image img={imgStep6} alt=""/>
</figure>

As shown above, configure advanced options for more detailed optimization of performance, logs, etc.

**Log Level** defaults to `info`, with options `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

In **Maximum Write Concurrency**, set the limit for the maximum number of concurrent writes to taosX. Default value: 0, meaning auto, automatically configures concurrency.

In **Batch Size**, set the batch size for each write, that is, the maximum number of messages sent at once.

In **Batch Delay**, set the maximum delay for a single send (in seconds). When the timeout ends, as long as there is data, it is sent immediately even if it does not meet the **Batch Size**.

In **Save Raw Data**, choose whether to save raw data. Default value: no.

When saving raw data, the following 2 parameters are effective.

In **Maximum Retention Days**, set the maximum retention days for raw data.

In **Raw Data Storage Directory**, set the path for saving raw data. If using Agent, the storage path refers to the path on the server where Agent is located, otherwise it is on the taosX server. The path can include placeholders `$DATA_DIR` and `:id` as part of the path.

- On Linux platform, `$DATA_DIR` is /var/lib/taos/taosx, by default the storage path is `/var/lib/taos/taosx/tasks/<task_id>/rawdata`.
- On Windows platform, `$DATA_DIR` is C:\TDengine\data\taosx, by default the storage path is `C:\TDengine\data\taosx\tasks\<task_id>\rawdata`.
