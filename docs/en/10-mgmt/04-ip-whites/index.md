description: This document describes how to configure an IP whitelist for your TDengine Cloud instance.
---

TDengine Cloud supports setting IP whitelist for the current instance. In the **IP White List** tab of the management page, if no IP address is added, any client can access the current TDengine Cloud instance. To maximize data security, customers can configure the IP whitelist to allow only the clients in the configured IP list to access the instance.

Note that if any IP is added, only clients with the IPs can access the current TDengine Cloud instance, and clients from other IPs will be denied by TDengine Cloud to access the instance.
