3. **Data Consolidation Across Sites:** With built-in connectors for a wide variety of industrial sources — MQTT, Kafka, OPC, PI System, and more — TDengine TSDB delivers zero-code data ingestion and extract, transform, and load (ETL) in a centralized platform that acts as a single source of truth for your business.
4. **Comprehensive Solution for Industrial Data:** With out-of-the-box data subscription, caching, and stream processing, TDengine TSDB is more than just a time-series database — it includes all key components needed for industrial data storage and processing built into a single product and accessible through familiar SQL statements.

## What TDengine TSDB Delivers

With its innovative "one table per device" design, unique supertable concept, and highly optimized storage engine, TDengine TSDB is purpose-built to meet the unique needs of ingesting, querying, and storing massive time-series datasets. In its role at the core of the industrial data architecture, it provides the following functionality:

1. [Data Ingestion](../basic-features/data-ingestion/): You can write data into TDengine TSDB with standard SQL or in schemaless mode over the InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDN Telnet Protocol, and OpenTSDB JSON Protocol. TDengine TSDB also seamlessly integrates with data collectors like Telegraf and Prometheus.
2. [Data Querying](../basic-features/data-querying): In addition to standard SQL query syntax, TDengine TSDB includes time-series extensions such as downsampling and windowing and functions such as cumulative sum and time-weighted average to better meet the needs of time-series data processing. TDengine TSDB also supports user-defined functions (UDF), which can be written in C or Python.
3. [Read Caching](../advanced-features/caching/): TDengine TSDB uses a time-driven first-in, first-out (FIFO) cache management strategy, keeping the most recent data in the cache. This makes it easy and fast to access the real-time status of any metric without the need for other caching tools like Redis, simplifying system architecture and reducing operational costs.
4. [Stream Processing](../advanced-features/stream-processing/): TDengine TSDB's built-in stream processing engine provides the capability to process data streams in real-time as they are written, supporting not only continuous queries but also event-driven stream processing. This lightweight but optimized solution can return results in milliseconds even during high-throughput data ingestion.
5. [Data Subscription](../advanced-features/data-subscription): TDengine TSDB includes data subscription out of the box, eliminating the need to deploy other complex products to provide this critical feature. You can define topics in SQL, subscribing to a query, supertable, or database, and use a Kafka-like API to consume these topics in your applications.
6. [Visualization](../third-party-tools/visualization/) and [BI](../third-party-tools/analytics/): Through its REST API and standard JDBC and ODBC interfaces, TDengine TSDB seamlessly integrates with leading platforms like Grafana, Power BI, and Seeq.
7. [Clustering](../operations-and-maintenance/deploy-your-cluster/): TDengine TSDB supports clustered deployment so that you can add nodes to scale your system and increase processing capacity. At the same time, it provides high availability through multi-replica technology and supports Kubernetes deployment. It also offers various operational tools to facilitate system administrators in managing and maintaining robust cluster operations.
8. Data Migration: TDengine TSDB provides various convenient data import and export functions, including script file import/export, data file import/export, and the [taosdump](../tdengine-reference/tools/taosdump/) tool.
9. [Client Libraries](../tdengine-reference/client-libraries/): TDengine TSDB offers client libraries for a variety of different programming languages, including Java, Python, and C/C++, so that you can build custom applications in your favorite language. Sample code that you can copy and paste into your apps is also provided to make the development process even easier.
10. O&M Tools: You can use the interactive [command-line interface (CLI)](../tdengine-reference/tools/tdengine-cli/) for managing clusters, checking system status, and performing ad hoc queries. The stress-testing tool [taosBenchmark](../tdengine-reference/tools/taosbenchmark/) is a quick way to generate sample data and test the performance of TDengine TSDB. And the [TDengine Explorer](../tdengine-reference/components/taosexplorer/) GUI simplifies the operations and management process.
11. [Data Security](https://tdengine.com/security/): With TDengine TSDB-Enterprise, you can implement fine-grained access controls with rich user and permissions management features. IP whitelisting helps you control which accounts can access your cluster from which servers, and audit logs record sensitive operations. In TDengine TSDB-Enterprise, you can also configure encryption in transit on the server level and encryption at rest on the database level, which is transparent to operations and has minimal impact on performance.
12. [Zero-Code Data Connectors](https://tdengine.com/data-sources/): TDengine TSDB-Enterprise includes zero-code connectors for industrial data protocols like MQTT and OPC, traditional data historians like AVEVA PI System and Wonderware Historian, relational databases like Oracle Database and SQL Server, and other time-series databases like InfluxDB and OpenTSDB. With these connectors, you can synchronize or migrate diverse time-series datasets to TDengine TSDB in the GUI without touching a line of code.
