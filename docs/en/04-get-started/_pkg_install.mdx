TDengine is easy to download and install.

The standard server installation package includes `taos`, `taosd`, `taosAdapter`, `taosBenchmark`, and sample code. You can also download a lite package that includes only `taosd` and the C/C++ client library.

You can download the TDengine installation package in .rpm, .deb, or .tar.gz format. The .tar.tz package includes `taosdump`  and the TDinsight installation script. If you want to use these utilities with the .deb or .rpm package, download and install taosTools separately.

Between official releases, beta versions may be released that contain new features. Do not use beta versions for production or testing environments. Select the installation package appropriate for your system.
