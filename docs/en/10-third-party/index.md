TDengine's support for standard SQL commands, common database connector standards (such as JDBC), ORM, and other popular time-series database writing protocols (such as InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB JSON, OpenTSDB Telnet, etc.) makes it very easy to use TDengine with third-party tools.

For supported third-party tools, no coding is required; you simply need to perform some basic configurations to seamlessly integrate TDengine with these tools.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
