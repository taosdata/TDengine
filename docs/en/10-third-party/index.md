import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

TDengine supports standard SQL commands, common database connector standards (such as JDBC), ORMs, and other popular time-series database write protocols (such as InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB JSON, OpenTSDB Telnet, etc.), making it very easy to use TDengine with third-party tools.

For supported third-party tools, no code is needed; you only need to do simple configuration to seamlessly integrate TDengine with these tools.
