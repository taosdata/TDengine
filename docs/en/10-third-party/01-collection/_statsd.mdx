### Configure taosAdapter

To configure taosAdapter to receive StatsD data:

- Enable the configuration item in the taosAdapter configuration file (default location is /etc/taos/taosadapter.toml)

```
...
[statsd]
enable = true
port = 6044
db = "statsd"
user = "root"
password = "taosdata"
worker = 10
gatherInterval = "5s"
protocol = "udp"
maxTCPConnections = 250
tcpKeepAlive = false
allowPendingMessages = 50000
deleteCounters = true
deleteGauges = true
deleteSets = true
deleteTimings = true
...
```

Here, the default database name written by taosAdapter is `statsd`, which can also be modified in the taosAdapter configuration file under the db field to specify a different name. The user and password should be filled with the actual TDengine configuration values. After modifying the configuration file, taosAdapter needs to be restarted.

- You can also enable the taosAdapter to receive StatsD data by using command line parameters or setting environment variables. For specific details, please refer to the taosAdapter reference manual.

### Configure StatsD

To use StatsD, you need to download its [source code](https://github.com/statsd/statsd). Please refer to the example file `exampleConfig.js` located in the root directory of the downloaded source code for configuration modifications. Here, \<taosAdapter's host> should be replaced with the domain name or IP address of the server running taosAdapter, and \<port for StatsD> should be the port that taosAdapter uses to receive StatsD data (default is 6044).

```
Add "./backends/repeater" to the backends section.
Add { host:'<taosAdapter's host>', port: <port for StatsD>} to the repeater section.
```

Example configuration file:

```
{
port: 8125
, backends: ["./backends/repeater"]
, repeater: [{ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6044}]
}
```

After adding the above content, start StatsD (assuming the configuration file is modified to config.js).

```
npm install
node stats.js config.js &
```
