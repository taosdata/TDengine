import CollectD from "../../assets/resources/_collectd.mdx"

collectd is a daemon for collecting system performance. collectd provides various storage mechanisms to store different values. It periodically collects relevant statistical information about the system while it is running and storing information. Utilizing this information helps identify current system performance bottlenecks and predict future system loads.

Simply point the collectd configuration to the domain name (or IP address) and corresponding port of the server running taosAdapter to write the data collected by collectd into TDengine, fully leveraging TDengine's efficient storage and query performance and cluster processing capabilities for time-series data.

## Prerequisites

Several preparations are needed to write collectd data into TDengine.

- TDengine cluster is deployed and running normally
- taosAdapter is installed and running normally, for details please refer to [taosAdapter User Manual](../../../tdengine-reference/components/taosadapter)
- collectd is installed. For installation of collectd, please refer to [official documentation](https://collectd.org/)

## Configuration Steps

<CollectD />

## Verification Method

Restart collectd

```shell
sudo systemctl restart collectd
```

Use TDengine CLI to verify that data is being written from collectd to TDengine and can be correctly read:
