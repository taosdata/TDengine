:::tip

1. Starting from version 3.4.0.0, the Enterprise Edition is not fully compatible with the Community Edition. To avoid compatibility issues when the two are interconnected, please ensure that you install the client driver corresponding to the server. Using a Community Edition driver to connect to an Enterprise Edition server will fail with error "Edition not compatible", and vice versa.
2. If using FQDN to connect to the server, ensure that the local network environment DNS is properly configured, or add FQDN addressing records in the hosts file, such as editing C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, adding records like: `192.168.1.99 h1.taos.com`
3. Uninstallation: Run unins000.exe to uninstall the TDengine application driver.
