#### Configure taosAdapter

Method to configure taosAdapter to receive StatsD data:

- Enable the configuration item in the taosAdapter configuration file (default location /etc/taos/taosadapter.toml)

    ```toml
    ...
    [statsd]
    enable = true
    port = 6044
    db = "statsd"
    user = "root"
    password = "taosdata"
    worker = 10
    gatherInterval = "5s"
    protocol = "udp"
    maxTCPConnections = 250
    tcpKeepAlive = false
    allowPendingMessages = 50000
    deleteCounters = true
    deleteGauges = true
    deleteSets = true
    deleteTimings = true
    ...
    ```

    The default database name written by taosAdapter is `statsd`, but you can also modify the db item in the taosAdapter configuration file to specify a different name. Fill in the user and password with the actual TDengine configuration values. After modifying the configuration file, taosAdapter needs to be restarted.

- You can also use taosAdapter command line arguments or set environment variables to enable the taosAdapter to receive StatsD data. For more details, please refer to the taosAdapter reference manual.

#### Configure StatsD

To use StatsD, download its [source code](https://github.com/statsd/statsd). Modify its configuration file according to the example file `exampleConfig.js` found in the root directory of the local source code download. Replace \<taosAdapter's host> with the domain name or IP address of the server running taosAdapter, and \<port for StatsD> with the port that taosAdapter uses to receive StatsD data (default is 6044).

```text
Add to the backends section "./backends/repeater"
Add to the repeater section { host:'<taosAdapter's host>', port: <port for StatsD>}
```

Example configuration file:

```js
{
port: 8125
, backends: ["./backends/repeater"]
, repeater: [{ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6044}]
}
```

After adding the following content, start StatsD (assuming the configuration file is modified to config.js).

```shell
npm install
node stats.js config.js &
```
