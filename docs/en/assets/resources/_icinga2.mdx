#### Configuring taosAdapter

Method to configure taosAdapter to receive icinga2 data:

- Enable the configuration item in the taosAdapter configuration file (default location /etc/taos/taosadapter.toml)

    ```toml
    ...
    [opentsdb_telnet]
    enable = true
    maxTCPConnections = 250
    tcpKeepAlive = false
    dbs = ["opentsdb_telnet", "collectd", "icinga2", "tcollector"]
    ports = [6046, 6047, 6048, 6049]
    user = "root"
    password = "taosdata"
    ...
    ```

    The default database name written by taosAdapter is `icinga2`, but you can also modify the dbs item in the taosAdapter configuration file to specify a different name. Fill in user and password with the actual TDengine configuration values. taosAdapter needs to be restarted after modifications.

- You can also use taosAdapter command line parameters or set environment variables to enable taosAdapter to receive icinga2 data, for more details please refer to the taosAdapter reference manual

#### Configuring icinga2

- Enable icinga2's opentsdb-writer (reference link https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/14-features/#opentsdb-writer)
- Modify the configuration file `/etc/icinga2/features-enabled/opentsdb.conf` filling in \<taosAdapter's host> with the domain name or IP address of the server running taosAdapter, \<port for icinga2> with the corresponding port supported by taosAdapter for receiving icinga2 data (default is 6048)

    ```c
    object OpenTsdbWriter "opentsdb" {
      host = "<taosAdapter's host>"
      port = <port for icinga2>
    }
    ```

    Example file:

    ```c
    object OpenTsdbWriter "opentsdb" {
      host = "127.0.0.1"
      port = 6048
    }
    ```
