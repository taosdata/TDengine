description: "Description of the TDengine installation directory"
---

After installing TDengine, the following directories or files are generated by default in the operating system:

| Directory/File            | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /usr/local/taos/bin       | Directory for TDengine executable files. Executables are symlinked to the /usr/bin directory. |
| /usr/local/taos/driver    | Directory for TDengine dynamic libraries. Libraries are symlinked to the /usr/lib directory. |
| /usr/local/taos/examples  | Directory for application examples in various languages.               |
| /usr/local/taos/include   | Header files for the C language interface provided by TDengine.        |
| /etc/taos/taos.cfg        | TDengine default [configuration file].                                 |
| /var/lib/taos             | Default data file directory. The location can be modified in the [configuration file]. |
| /var/log/taos             | Default log file directory. The location can be modified in the [configuration file]. |

## Executable Files

All TDengine executable files are stored by default in the _/usr/local/taos/bin_ directory, including:

- _taosd_: TDengine server executable
- _taos_: TDengine shell executable
- _taosdump_: Data import and export tool
- _taosBenchmark_: TDengine benchmarking tool
- _remove.sh_: Script for uninstalling TDengine. Use with caution. This script is linked to the **rmtaos** command in /usr/bin and removes the installation directory /usr/local/taos but preserves /etc/taos, /var/lib/taos, and /var/log/taos.
- _taosadapter_: Server executable that provides RESTful services and supports various software write requests.
- _TDinsight.sh_: Script for downloading and installing TDinsight.
- _set_core.sh_: Script to facilitate debugging by setting the system to generate core dump files.
- _taosd-dump-cfg.gdb_: GDB script for debugging the execution of taosd.

:::note
The _taosdump_ tool requires a separate installation package called taosTools.

:::tip
You can modify the system configuration file _taos.cfg_ to customize the data and log directories.
