## Fault Tolerance

TDengine uses **WAL**, i.e. Write Ahead Log, to achieve fault tolerance and high reliability.

When a data block is received by TDengine, the original data block is first written into WAL. The log in WAL will be deleted only after the data has been written into data files in the database. Data can be recovered from WAL in case the server is stopped abnormally for any reason and then restarted.

There are 2 configuration parameters related to WAL:

- wal_level: Specifies the WAL level. 1 indicates that WAL is enabled but fsync is disabled. 2 indicates that WAL and fsync are both enabled. The default value is 1.
- wal_fsync_period: This parameter is only valid when wal_level is set to 2. It specifies the interval, in milliseconds, of invoking fsync. If set to 0, it means fsync is invoked immediately once WAL is written.

To achieve absolutely no data loss, set wal_level to 2 and wal_fsync_period to 0. There is a performance penalty to the data ingestion rate. However, if the concurrent data insertion threads on the client side can reach a big enough number, for example 50, the data ingestion performance will be still good enough. Our verification shows that the drop is only 30% when wal_fsync_period is set to 3000 milliseconds.

## Disaster Recovery

TDengine uses replication to provide high availability.

A TDengine cluster is managed by mnodes. You can configure up to three mnodes to ensure high availability. The data replication between mnode replicas is performed in a synchronous way to guarantee metadata consistency.

The number of replicas for time series data in TDengine is associated with each database. There can be many databases in a cluster and each database can be configured with a different number of replicas. When creating a database, the parameter `replica` is used to specify the number of replicas. To achieve high availability, set `replica` to 3.

The number of dnodes in a TDengine cluster must NOT be lower than the number of replicas for any database, otherwise it would fail when trying to create a table.

As long as the dnodes of a TDengine cluster are deployed on different physical machines and the replica number is higher than 1, high availability can be achieved without any other assistance. For disaster recovery, dnodes of a TDengine cluster should be deployed in geographically different data centers.

Alternatively, you can use taosX to synchronize the data from one TDengine cluster to another cluster in a remote location. However, taosX is only available in TDengine enterprise version, for more information please contact tdengine.com.
