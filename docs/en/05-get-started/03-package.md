This document describes how to install TDengine on Linux/Windows/macOS and perform queries and inserts.

- The easiest way to explore TDengine is through [TDengine Cloud](https://cloud.tdengine.com). 
- To get started with TDengine on Docker, see [Quick Install on Docker](../../get-started/docker).
- If you want to view the source code, build TDengine yourself, or contribute to the project, see the [TDengine GitHub repository](https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine).

The full package of TDengine includes the TDengine Server (`taosd`), TDengine Client (`taosc`), taosAdapter for connecting with third-party systems and providing a RESTful interface, a command-line interface (CLI, taos), and some tools. Note that taosAdapter supports Linux only. In addition to client libraries for multiple languages, TDengine also provides a [REST API](../../reference/rest-api) through [taosAdapter](../../reference/taosadapter).

The standard server installation package includes `taos`, `taosd`, `taosAdapter`, `taosBenchmark`, and sample code. You can also download the Lite package that includes only `taosd` and the C/C++ client library.

TDengine OSS is released as Deb and RPM packages. The Deb package can be installed on Debian, Ubuntu, and derivative systems. The RPM package can be installed on CentOS, RHEL, SUSE, and derivative systems. A .tar.gz package is also provided for enterprise customers, and you can install TDengine over `apt-get` as well. The .tar.tz package includes `taosdump` and the TDinsight installation script. If you want to use these utilities with the Deb or RPM package, download and install taosTools separately. TDengine can also be installed on x64 Windows and x64/m1 macOS.

## Operating environment requirements
In the Linux system, the minimum requirements for the operating environment are as follows:

linux core version - 3.10.0-1160.83.1.el7.x86_64;

glibc version - 2.17;

If compiling and installing through clone source code, it is also necessary to meet the following requirements:

cmake version - 3.26.4 or above;

gcc version - 9.3.1 or above;

## Installation

**Note**

Since TDengine 3.0.6.0, we don't provide standalone taosTools pacakge for downloading. However, all the tools included in the taosTools pacakge can be found in TDengine-server pacakge.

## Quick Launch

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux" value="linux">

After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the TDengine service:

```bash
systemctl start taosd
systemctl start taosadapter
systemctl start taoskeeper
systemctl start taos-explorer
```

Or you can run a scrip to start all the above services together

```bash
start-all.sh 
```

systemctl can also be used to stop, restart a specific service or check its status, like below using `taosd` as example:

```bash
systemctl start taosd
systemctl stop taosd
systemctl restart taosd
systemctl status taosd
```

:::info

- The `systemctl` command requires _root_ privileges. If you are not logged in as the _root_ user, use the `sudo` command.
- The `systemctl stop taosd` command does not instantly stop TDengine Server. The server is stopped only after all data in memory is flushed to disk. The time required depends on the cache size.
- If your system does not include `systemd`, you can run `/usr/local/taos/bin/taosd` to start TDengine manually.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows" value="windows">

After the installation is complete, please run `sc start taosd` or run `C:\TDengine\taosd.exe` with administrator privilege to start TDengine Server. Please run `sc start taosadapter` or run `C:\TDengine\taosadapter.exe` with administrator privilege to start taosAdapter to provide http/REST service.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS" value="macos">

After the installation is complete, double-click the /applications/TDengine to start the program, or run `sudo launchctl start ` to start TDengine services.

```bash
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taosd
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taosadapter
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taoskeeper
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taos-explorer
```

Or you can run a scrip to start all the above services together
```bash
start-all.sh 
```

The following `launchctl` commands can help you manage TDengine service, using `taosd` service as an example below:

```bash
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taosd
sudo launchctl stop com.tdengine.taosd
sudo launchctl list | grep taosd
sudo launchctl print system/com.tdengine.taosd
```

:::info
- Please use `sudo` to run `launchctl` to manage _com.tdengine.taosd_ with administrator privileges.
- The administrator privilege is required for service management to enhance security.
- Troubleshooting:
- The first column returned by the command `launchctl list | grep taosd` is the PID of the program. If it's `-`, that means the TDengine service is not running.
- If the service is abnormal, please check the `launchd.log` file from the system log or the `taosdlog` from the `/var/log/taos directory` for more information.

## TDengine Command Line Interface

You can use the TDengine CLI to monitor your TDengine deployment and execute ad hoc queries. To open the CLI, you can execute `taos` (Linux/Mac) or `taos.exe` (Windows) in terminal. The prompt of TDengine CLI is like below:

```cmd
taos>
```

Using TDengine CLI, you can create and delete databases and tables and run all types of queries. Each SQL command must be end with a semicolon (;). For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE demo;
USE demo;
CREATE TABLE t (ts TIMESTAMP, speed INT);
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('2019-07-15 00:00:00', 10);
INSERT INTO t VALUES ('2019-07-15 01:00:00', 20);
SELECT * FROM t;

           ts            |    speed    |
========================================
 2019-07-15 00:00:00.000 |          10 |
 2019-07-15 01:00:00.000 |          20 |

Query OK, 2 row(s) in set (0.003128s)
```

You can also can monitor the deployment status, add and remove user accounts, and manage running instances. You can run the TDengine CLI on either machines. For more information, see [TDengine CLI](../../reference/taos-shell/).

## TDengine Graphic User Interface

From TDengine 3.3.0.0, there is a new componenet called `taos-explorer` added in the TDengine docker image. You can use it to manage the databases, super tables, child tables, and data in your TDengine system. There are also some features only available in TDengine Enterprise Edition, please contact TDengine sales team in case you need these features.

To use taos-explorer in the container, you need to access the host port mapped from container port 6060. Assuming the host name is abc.com, and the port used on host is 6060, you need to access `http://abc.com:6060`. taos-explorer uses port 6060 by default in the container. When you use it the first time, you need to register with your enterprise email, then can logon using your user name and password in the TDengine 

## Test data insert performance

After your TDengine Server is running normally, you can run the taosBenchmark utility to test its performance:

Start TDengine service and execute `taosBenchmark` (formerly named `taosdemo`) in a terminal.

```bash
taosBenchmark
```

This command creates the `meters` supertable in the `test` database. In the `meters` supertable, it then creates 10,000 subtables named `d0` to `d9999`. Each table has 10,000 rows and each row has four columns: `ts`, `current`, `voltage`, and `phase`. The timestamps of the data in these columns range from 2017-07-14 10:40:00 000 to 2017-07-14 10:40:09 999. Each table is randomly assigned a `groupId` tag from 1 to 10 and a `location` tag of either `California.Campbell`, `California.Cupertino`, `California.LosAngeles`, `California.MountainView`, `California.PaloAlto`, `California.SanDiego`, `California.SanFrancisco`, `California.SanJose`, `California.SantaClara` or `California.Sunnyvale`.

The `taosBenchmark` command creates a deployment with 100 million data points that you can use for testing purposes. The time required to create the deployment depends on your hardware. On most modern servers, the deployment is created in ten to twenty seconds.

You can customize the test deployment that taosBenchmark creates by specifying command-line parameters. For information about command-line parameters, run the `taosBenchmark --help` command. For more information about taosBenchmark, see [taosBenchmark](../../reference/taosbenchmark).

## Test data query performance

After using `taosBenchmark` to create your test deployment, you can run queries in the TDengine CLI to test its performance:

From the TDengine CLI (taos) query the number of rows in the `meters` supertable:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test.meters;
```

Query the average, maximum, and minimum values of all 100 million rows of data:

```sql
SELECT AVG(current), MAX(voltage), MIN(phase) FROM test.meters;
```

Query the number of rows whose `location` tag is `California.SanFrancisco`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test.meters WHERE location = "California.SanFrancisco";
```

Query the average, maximum, and minimum values of all rows whose `groupId` tag is `10`:

```sql
SELECT AVG(current), MAX(voltage), MIN(phase) FROM test.meters WHERE groupId = 10;
```

Query the average, maximum, and minimum values for table `d10` in 10 second intervals:

```sql
SELECT FIRST(ts), AVG(current), MAX(voltage), MIN(phase) FROM test.d10 INTERVAL(10s);
```

In the query above you are selecting the first timestamp (ts) in the interval, another way of selecting this would be `\_wstart` which will give the start of the time window. For more information about windowed queries, see [Time-Series Extensions](../../taos-sql/distinguished/).
