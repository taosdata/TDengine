You can install and run TDengine on Linux/Windows/macOS machines as well as Docker containers. You can also deploy TDengine as a managed service with TDengine Cloud.

The full package of TDengine includes the TDengine Server (`taosd`), TDengine Client (`taosc`), taosAdapter for connecting with third-party systems and providing a RESTful interface, a command-line interface, and some tools. In addition to connectors for multiple languages, TDengine also provides a [RESTful interface](/reference/rest-api) through [taosAdapter](/reference/taosadapter).
