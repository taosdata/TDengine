```rust title="Native Connection"
{{#include docs/examples/rust/nativeexample/examples/connect.rs}}
```

:::note
For the Rust connector, the difference in connection methods only reflects the different features used. If the "ws" feature is enabled, only the WebSocket implementation will be compiled in.
