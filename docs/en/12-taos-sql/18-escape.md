|       `\\`       | Back Slash \             |
|       `\%`       | % see below for details  |
|       `\_`       | \_ see below for details |

## Restrictions

1. If there are escape characters in identifiers (database name, table name, column name)
   - Identifier without ``: Error will be returned because identifier must be constituted of digits, ASCII characters or underscore and can't be started with digits
   - Identifier quoted with ``ï¼š Original content is kept, no escaping
2. If there are escape characters in values
   - The escape characters will be escaped as the above table. If the escape character doesn't match any supported one, the escape character "\" will be ignored.
   - "%" and "\_" are used as wildcards in `like`. `\%` and `\_` should be used to represent literal "%" and "\_" in `like`,. If `\%` and `\_` are used out of `like` context, the evaluation result is "`\%`"and "`\_`", instead of "%" and "\_".
