```

**Description**ï¼š`elapsed` function can be used to calculate the continuous time length in which there is valid data. If it's used with `INTERVAL` clause, the returned result is the calcualted time length within each time window. If it's used without `INTERVAL` caluse, the returned result is the calculated time duration within the specified time range. Please be noted that the calculated time duration is in the specified `time_unit`.

**Return value type**ï¼šDOUBLE.

**Applicable tables**: table, STable, outter in nested query.

**Explanations**ï¼š

- `field_name` parameter can only be the first column of a table, i.e. timestamp primary key.
- The minimum value of `time_unit` is the time precision of the database. If `time_unit` is not specified, the time precision of the database is used as the default ime unit.
- It can be used with `INTERVAL` to get the time valid time length of each time window. Please be noted that the return value is same as the time window for all time windows except for the first and the last time window.
- `order by asc/desc` has no effect on the result.
- `group by tbname` must be used together when `elapsed` is used against a STable.
- `group by` must NOT be used together when `elapsed` is used against a table or sub table.
- When used in nested query, it's only applicable when the inner query outputs an implicit timestamp column as the primary key. For example, `select elapsed(ts) from (select diff(value) from sub1)` is legal usage while `select elapsed(ts) from (select * from sub1)` is not.
- It cannot be used with `leastsquares`, `diff`, `derivative`, `top`, `bottom`, `last_row`, `interp`.

### LEASTSQUARES

2. bin_description: parameter to describe the rule to generate bucketsï¼Œcan be in the following JSON formats for each bin_type respectively:

   - "user_input": "[1, 3, 5, 7]": User specified bin values.

   - "linear_bin": "{"start": 0.0, "width": 5.0, "count": 5, "infinity": true}"
     "start" - bin starting point.
     "width" - bin offset.
     "count" - number of bins generated.
     "infinity" - whether to addï¼ˆ-inf, infï¼‰as start/end point in generated set of bins.
     The above "linear_bin" descriptor generates a set of bins: [-inf, 0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, +inf].

   - "log_bin": "{"start":1.0, "factor": 2.0, "count": 5, "infinity": true}"
     "start" - bin starting point.
     "factor" - exponential factor of bin offset.
     "count" - number of bins generated.
     "infinity" - whether to addï¼ˆ-inf, infï¼‰as start/end point in generated range of bins.
     The above "log_bin" descriptor generates a set of bins:[-inf, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, +inf].

3. normalized: setting to 1/0 to turn on/off result normalization.

### PERCENTILE

- NULL will be returned if all the values of the specified column are all NULL
- A result will NOT be returned if all the columns in the result set are all NULL

### INTERP

```
SELECT INTERP(field_name) FROM { tb_name | stb_name } [WHERE where_condition] [ RANGE(timestamp1,timestamp2) ] [EVERY(interval)] [FILL ({ VALUE | PREV | NULL | LINEAR | NEXT})];
```

**Description**: The value that matches the specified timestamp range is returned, if existing; or an interpolation value is returned.

**Return value type**: Same as the column being operated upon.

**Applicable column types**: Numeric data types.

**Applicable table types**: table, STable, nested query.

**More explanations**

- `INTERP` is used to get the value that matches the specified time slice from a column. If no such value exists an interpolation value will be returned based on `FILL` parameter.
- The input data of `INTERP` is the value of the specified column and a `where` clause can be used to filter the original data. If no `where` condition is specified then all original data is the input.
- The output time range of `INTERP` is specified by `RANGE(timestamp1,timestamp2)` parameter, with timestamp1<=timestamp2. timestamp1 is the starting point of the output time range and must be specified. timestamp2 is the ending point of the output time range and must be specified. If `RANGE` is not specified, then the timestamp of the first row that matches the filter condition is treated as timestamp1, the timestamp of the last row that matches the filter condition is treated as timestamp2.
- The number of rows in the result set of `INTERP` is determined by the parameter `EVERY`. Starting from timestamp1, one interpolation is performed for every time interval specified `EVERY` parameter. If `EVERY` parameter is not used, the time windows will be considered as no ending timestamp, i.e. there is only one time window from timestamp1.
- Interpolation is performed based on `FILL` parameter. No interpolation is performed if `FILL` is not used, that means either the original data that matches is returned or nothing is returned.
- `INTERP` can only be used to interpolate in single timeline. So it must be used with `group by tbname` when it's used on a STable. It can't be used with `GROUP BY` when it's used in the inner query of a nested query.
- The result of `INTERP` is not influenced by `ORDER BY TIMESTAMP`, which impacts the output order only..

### LAST

```
SELECT LAST(field_name) FROM { tb_name | stb_name } [WHERE clause];
```

**Description**: The last non-NULL value of a specific column in a table or STable.

**Return value type**: Same as the column being operated upon.

**Applicable column types**: All data types.

**Applicable table types**: table, STable.

**More explanations**:

- LAST(\*) can be used to get the last non-NULL value of all columns
- If the values of a column in the result set are all NULL, NULL is returned for that column; if all columns in the result are all NULL, no result will be returned.
- When it's used on a STable, if there are multiple values with the timestamp in the result set, one of them will be returned randomly and it's not guaranteed that the same value is returned if the same query is run multiple times.

### LAST_ROW

```
SELECT LAST_ROW(field_name) FROM { tb_name | stb_name };
```

**Description**: The last row of a table or STable.

**Return value type**: Same as the column being operated upon.

**Applicable column types**: All data type.

### UNIQUE

```
SELECT UNIQUE(field_name) FROM {tb_name | stb_name} [WHERE clause];
```

**Return value type**: Same as the column or tag being operated upon.

**Applicable column types**: All data types.

**More explanations**:

- It can be used against table or STable, but can't be used together with time window, like `interval`, `state_window` or `session_window` .
- Considering the number of result sets is unpredictable, it's suggested to limit the distinct values under 100,000 to control the memory usage, otherwise error will be returned.

## Time-Series Specific Functions

TDengine provides a set of time-series specific functions to better meet the requirements in querying time-series data. In general databases, similar functionalities can only be achieved with much more complex syntax and much worse performance. TDengine provides these functionalities in builtin functions so that the burden on user side is minimized.
