# TDengine Documentation

TDengine is a highly efficient platform to store, query, and analyze time-series data. It is specially designed and optimized for IoT, Internet of Vehicles, Industrial IoT, IT Infrastructure and Application Monitoring, etc. It works like a relational database, such as MySQL, but you are strongly encouraged to read through the following documentation before you experience it, especially the [Data Model](../03.architecture/docs.md) and [Data Modeling](../04.model/docs.md) sections. In addition to this document, you should also download and read our technology white paper. For the older TDengine version 1.6 documentation, please click here.
