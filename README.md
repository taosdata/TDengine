# 3. Prerequisites

At the moment, TDengine server supports running on Linux/Windows/MacOS systems. Any application can also choose the RESTful interface provided by taosAdapter to connect the taosd service. TDengine supports X64/ARM64 CPU, and it will support MIPS64, Alpha64, ARM32, RISC-V and other CPU architectures in the future. Right now we don't support build with cross-compiling environment.

If you want to compile taosAdapter or taosKeeper, you need to install Go 1.18 or above.

```

</details>

# 4. Building

TDengine provide a few useful tools such as taosBenchmark (was named taosdemo) and taosdump. They were part of TDengine. By default, TDengine compiling does not include taosTools. You can use `cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true` to make them be compiled with TDengine.

TDengine requires [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 9.3.1 or higher and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.13.0 or higher for building.

## 4.1 Build on Linux

<details>

<summary>Detailed steps to build on Linux</summary>

You can run the bash script `build.sh` to build both TDengine and taosTools including taosBenchmark and taosdump as below:

```bash
./build.sh
```

It equals to execute following commands:

```bash
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true -DBUILD_CONTRIB=true
make
```

If you want to compile taosAdapter, you need to add the `-DBUILD_HTTP=false` option.

If you want to compile taosKeeper, you need to add the `--DBUILD_KEEPER=true` option.

You can use Jemalloc as memory allocator instead of glibc:

```bash
cmake .. -DJEMALLOC_ENABLED=ON
```

TDengine build script can auto-detect the host machine's architecture on x86, x86-64, arm64 platform.
You can also specify architecture manually by CPUTYPE option:

```bash
cmake .. -DCPUTYPE=aarch64 && cmake --build .
```

</details>

## 4.2 Build on macOS

<details>

<summary>Detailed steps to build on macOS</summary>

Please install XCode command line tools and cmake. Verified with XCode 11.4+ on Catalina and Big Sur.

```shell
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

If you want to compile taosAdapter, you need to add the `-DBUILD_HTTP=false` option.

If you want to compile taosKeeper, you need to add the `--DBUILD_KEEPER=true` option.

</details>

## 4.3 Build on Windows

<details>

<summary>Detailed steps to build on Windows</summary>

If you use the Visual Studio 2013, please open a command window by executing "cmd.exe".
Please specify "amd64" for 64 bits Windows or specify "x86" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat.

```cmd
mkdir debug && cd debug
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" < amd64 | x86 >
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
```

If you use the Visual Studio 2019 or 2017:

please open a command window by executing "cmd.exe".
Please specify "x64" for 64 bits Windows or specify "x86" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat.

```cmd
mkdir debug && cd debug
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" < x64 | x86 >
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
