# 3. Prerequisites

At the moment, TDengine server supports running on Linux/MacOS systems. Any application can also choose the RESTful interface provided by taosAdapter to connect the taosd service. TDengine supports X64/ARM64 CPU, and it will support MIPS64, Alpha64, ARM32, RISC-V and other CPU architectures in the future. Right now we don't support build with cross-compiling environment.

Starting from version 3.1.0.0, TDengine supports the Windows system exclusively in its Enterprise edition.

If you want to compile taosAdapter or taosKeeper, you need to install Go 1.23 or above.

## 3.4 Clone the repo

Clone the repository to the target machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine.git
cd TDengine
```

</details>

# 4. Building

TDengine provide a few useful tools such as taosBenchmark (was named taosdemo) and taosdump. They were part of TDengine. By default, TDengine compiling does not include taosTools. You can use `cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true` to make them be compiled with TDengine.

TDengine requires [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 9.3.1 or higher and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.18.0 or higher for building.

## 4.1 Build on Linux

<details>

<summary>Detailed steps to build on Linux</summary>

You can run the bash script `build.sh` to build both TDengine and taosTools including taosBenchmark and taosdump as below:

```bash
./build.sh
```

It equals to execute following commands:

```bash
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true -DBUILD_CONTRIB=true
make
```

If you want to compile taosAdapter, you need to add the `-DBUILD_HTTP=false` option.

If you want to compile taosKeeper, you need to add the `-DBUILD_KEEPER=true` option.

You can use Jemalloc as memory allocator instead of glibc:

```bash
cmake .. -DJEMALLOC_ENABLED=ON
```

TDengine build script can auto-detect the host machine's architecture on x86, x86-64, arm64 platform.
You can also specify architecture manually by CPUTYPE option:

```bash
cmake .. -DCPUTYPE=aarch64 && cmake --build .
```

</details>

## 4.2 Build on macOS

<details>

<summary>Detailed steps to build on macOS</summary>

Please install XCode command line tools and cmake. Verified with XCode 11.4+ on Catalina and Big Sur.

```shell
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

If you want to compile taosAdapter, you need to add the `-DBUILD_HTTP=false` option.

If you want to compile taosKeeper, you need to add the `-DBUILD_KEEPER=true` option.

```bash
taos
```

If TDengine CLI connects the server successfully, welcome messages and version info are printed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

If you don't want to run TDengine as a service, you can run it in current shell. For example, to quickly start a TDengine server after building, run the command below in terminal: (We take Linux as an example, command on Windows will be `taosd.exe`)

```bash
./build/bin/taosd -c test/cfg
```

In another terminal, use the TDengine CLI to connect the server:

```bash
./build/bin/taos -c test/cfg
```

Option `-c test/cfg` specifies the system configuration file directory.
