<body>
Generate specific Java classes for schemas and protocols.

<p>This API is recommended for most RPC uses and for data applications
  that always use the same datatypes, i.e., whose schemas are known at
  compile time.  For data applications that accept dynamic datatypes
  the {@link org.apache.avro.generic generic} API is recommended.

<p>Avro types are mapped to Java as follows:

<ul>

<li>Record, enum, and fixed schemas generate Java class definitions.</li>

<li>If a Conversion instance is available for the related logical type,
  the value will be mapped to the object returned by that Conversion. The
  logical type conversions for {@code date}, {@code time-millis}, {@code
  timestamp-millis} and {@code decimal} are pre-defined in the class {@link
  <a href="../../../../org/apache/avro/compiler/specific/SpecificCompiler.html" title="class in org.apache.avro.compiler.specific"><code>SpecificCompiler</code></a>}.</li>

<li>All other types are mapped as in the {@link org.apache.avro.generic
  generic} API.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that when a generated class is not found corresponding to a
  record, enum or fixed schema, a {@link org.apache.avro.generic
  generic} representation is used.  This permits generated classes to
  be nested within generic data structures.
