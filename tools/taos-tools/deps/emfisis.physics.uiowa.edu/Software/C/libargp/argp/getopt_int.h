  /* Describe how to deal with options that follow non-option ARGV-elements.

     If the caller did not specify anything,
     the default is REQUIRE_ORDER if the environment variable
     POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, PERMUTE otherwise.

     REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options;
     stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.
     This is what Unix does.
     This mode of operation is selected by either setting the environment
     variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character
     of the list of option characters.

     PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of ARGV as we
     scan, so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.
     This allows options to be given in any order, even with programs
     that were not written to expect this.

     RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were
     written to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order
     and that care about the ordering of the two.  We describe each
     non-option ARGV-element as if it were the argument of an option
     with character code 1.  Using `-' as the first character of the
     list of option characters selects this mode of operation.

     The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
     of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
     `--' can cause `getopt' to return -1 with `optind' != ARGC.  */
